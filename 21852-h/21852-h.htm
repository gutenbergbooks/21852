<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f I have essayed to do in this book what should
have been done by one of the masters of the science
of folklore&mdash;Mr. Frazer, Mr. Lang, Mr. Hartland,
Mr. Clodd, Sir John Rhys, and others&mdash;I hope it will
not be put down to any feelings of self-sufficiency on
my part. I have greatly dared because no one of them
has accomplished, and I have so acted because I feel
the necessity of some guidance in these matters, and
more particularly at the present stage of inquiry into
the early history of man.</p>

<p>I have thought I could give somewhat of that
guidance because of my comprehension of its need, for
the comprehension of a need is sometimes half-way
towards supplying the need. My profound belief in
the value of folklore as perhaps the only means of
discovering the earliest stages of the psychological,
religious, social, and political history of modern man
has also entered into my reason for the attempt.</p>

<p>Many years ago I suggested the necessity for guidance,
and I sketched out a few of the points involved
(<i>Folklore Journal</i>, ii. 285, 347; iii. 1-16) in what was
afterwards called by a friendly critic a sort of grammar
of folklore. The science of folklore has advanced far
since 1885 however, and not only new problems but
new ranges of thought have gathered round it. Still,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</a></span>
the claims of folklore as a definite section of historical
material remain not only unrecognised but unstated,
and as long as this is so the lesser writers on folklore will
go on working in wrong directions and producing much
mischief, and the historian will judge of folklore by the
criteria presented by these writers&mdash;will judge wrongly
and will neglect folklore accordingly.</p>

<p>I hope this book may tend to correct this state of
things to some extent. It is not easy to write on such
a subject in a limited space, and it is difficult to avoid
being somewhat severely technical at points. These
demerits will, I am sure, be forgiven when considered
by the light of the human interest involved.</p>

<p>All studies of this kind must begin from the standpoint
of a definite culture area, and I have chosen our
own country for the purpose of this inquiry. This
will make the illustrations more interesting to the
English reader; but it must be borne in mind that
the same process could be repeated for other areas
if my estimate of the position is even tolerably accurate.
For the purpose of this estimate it was necessary,
in the first place, to show how pure history was
intimately related to folklore at many stages, and
yet how this relationship had been ignored by both
historian and folklorist. The research for this purpose
had necessarily to deal with much detail, and to
introduce fresh elements of research. There is thus
produced a somewhat unequal treatment; for when
illustrations have to be worked out at length, because
they appear for the first time, the mind is apt to wander
from the main point at issue and to become lost in the
subordinate issue arising from the working out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</a></span>
chosen illustration. This, I fear, is inevitable in
folklore research, and I can only hope I have overcome
some of the difficulties caused thereby in a fairly satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>The next stage takes us to a consideration of
materials and methods, in order to show the means and
definitions which are necessary if folklore research is
to be conducted on scientific lines. Not only is it
necessary to ascertain the proper position of each
item of folklore in the culture area in which it is found,
but it is also necessary to ascertain its scientific
relationship to other items found in the same area;
and I have protested against the too easy attempt to
proceed upon the comparative method. Before we
can compare we must be certain that we are comparing
like quantities.</p>

<p>These chapters are preliminary. After this stage we
proceed to the principal issues, and the first of these
deals with the psychological conditions. It was only
necessary to treat of this subject shortly, because the
illustrations of it do not need analysis. They are
self-contained, and supply their own evidence as to the
place they occupy.</p>

<p>The anthropological conditions involve very different
treatment. The great fact necessary to bear in
mind is that the people of a modern culture area have
an anthropological as well as a national or political
history, and that it is only the anthropological history
which can explain the meaning and existence of
folklore. This subject found me compelled to go
rather more deeply than I had thought would be
necessary into first principles, but I hope I have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</a></span>
altogether failed to prove that to properly understand
the province of folklore it is necessary to know
something of anthropological research and its results.
In point of fact, without this consideration of folklore,
there is not much value to be obtained from it. It is
not because it consists of traditions, superstitions,
customs, beliefs, observances, and what not, that
folklore is of value to science. It is because the
various constituents are survivals of something much
more essential to mankind than fragments of life which
for all practical purposes of progress might well
disappear from the world. As survivals, folklore
belongs to anthropological data, and if, as I contend, we
can go so far back into survivals as totemism, we must
understand generally what position totemism occupies
among human institutions, and to understand this we
must fall back to human origins.</p>

<p>The next divisions are more subordinate. Sociological
conditions must be studied apart from their
anthropological aspect, because in the higher races the
social group is knit together far more strongly and
with far greater purpose than among the lower races.
The social force takes the foremost place among the
influences towards the higher development, and it is
necessary not only to study this but to be sure of the
terms we use. Tribe, clan, family, and other terms
have been loosely used in anthropology, just as state,
city, village, and now village-community, are loosely
used in history. The great fact to understand is that
the social group of the higher races was based on
blood kinship at the time when they set out to take
their place in modern civilisation, and that we cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg&nbsp;xv]</a></span>
understand survivals in folklore unless we test them by
their position as part of a tribal organisation. The
point has never been taken before, and yet I do not see
how it can be dismissed.</p>

<p>The consideration of European conditions is chiefly
concerned with the all-important fact of an intrusive
religion, that of Christianity, from without, destroying
the native religions with which it came into contact,
conditions which would of course apply only to the
folklore of European countries.</p>

<p>Finally, I have discussed ethnological conditions in
order to show that certain fundamental differences in
folklore can be and ought to be explained as the results
of different race origins. We are now getting rid of
the notion that all Europe is peopled by the descendants
of the so-called Aryans. There is too much evidence
to show that the still older races lived on after they were
conquered by Celt, Teuton, Scandinavian, or Slav, and
there is no reason why folklore should not share with
language, arch&aelig;ology, and physical type the inheritance
from this earliest race.</p>

<p>In this manner I have surveyed the several conditions
attachable to the study of folklore and the
various departments of science with which it is inseparably
associated. Folklore cannot be studied
alone. Alone it is of little worth. As part of the
inheritance from bygone ages it cannot separate itself
from the conditions of bygone ages. Those who
would study it carefully, and with purpose, must consider
it in the light which is shed by it and upon it
from all that is contributory to the history of man.</p>

<p>During my exposition I have ventured upon many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg&nbsp;xvi]</a></span>
criticisms of masters in the various departments of
knowledge into which I have penetrated; but in all
cases with great respect. Criticism, such as I have
indulged in, is nothing more than a respectful difference
of opinion on the particular points under discussion,
and which need every light which can be thrown upon
them, even by the humblest student.</p>

<p>I am particularly obliged to Mr. Lang, Mr. Hartland,
Dr. Haddon, and Dr. Rivers, for kindly reading my
chapter on Anthropological Conditions, and for much
valuable and kind help therein; and especially I owe
Mr. Lang most grateful thanks, for he took an immense
deal of trouble and gave me the advantage of his
searching criticism, always in the direction of an endeavour
to perfect my faulty evidence. I shall not
readily part with his letters and MS. on this subject,
for they show alike his generosity and his brilliance.</p>

<p>To my old friend Mr. Fairman Ordish I am once
more indebted for help in reading my sheets, and I am
also glad to acknowledge the fact that two of my sons,
Allan Gomme and Wycombe Gomme, have read my
proofs and helped me much, not only by their criticism,
but by their knowledge.</p>

<h2>FOLKLORE AS AN HISTORICAL SCIENCE</h2>

</p>



<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>HISTORY AND FOLKLORE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>t may be stated as a general rule that history and
folklore are not considered as complementary
studies. Historians deny the validity of folklore
as evidence of history, and folklorists ignore the essence
of history which exists in folklore. Of late years it is
true that Dr. Frazer, Prof. Ridgeway, Mr. Warde
Fowler, Miss Harrison, Mr. Lang, and others have
broken through this antagonism and shown that the
two studies stand together; but this is only in certain
special directions, and no movement is apparent that
the brilliant results of special inquiries are to bring
about a general consideration of the mutual help which
the two studies afford, if in their respective spheres the
evidence is treated with caution and knowledge, and if
the evidence from each is brought to bear upon the
necessities of each.</p>

<p>The necessities of history are obvious. There are considerable
gaps in historical knowledge, and the further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
back we desire to penetrate the scantier must be the
material at the historian's disposal. In any case there
can be only two considerable sources of historical knowledge,
namely, foreign and native. Looking at the subject
from the points presented by the early history of
our own country, there are the Greek and Latin writers
to whom Britain was a source of interest as the most
distant part of the then known world, and the native
historians, who, witnessing the terribly changing events
which followed the break-up of the Roman dominion
over Britain, recorded their views of the changes and
their causes, and in course of time recorded also some of
the events of Celtic history and of Anglo-Saxon history.
Then for later periods, no country of the Western
world possesses such magnificent materials for history
as our own. In the vast quantity of public and private
documents which are gradually being made accessible
to the student there exists material for the illustration
and elucidation of almost every side and every period
of national life, and no branch of historical research is
more fruitful of results than the comparison of the
records of the professed historian with the documents
which have not come from the historian's hands.</p>

<p>All this, however, does not give us the complete
story. Necessarily there are great and important gaps.
Contemporary writers make themselves the judges of
what is important to record; documents preserved in
public or private archives relate only to such events as
need or command the written record or instrument, or
to those which have interested some of the actors and
their families. Hence in both departments of history,
the historical narrative and the original record, it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
be found on careful examination that much is needed to
make the picture of life complete. It is the detail of
everyday thought and action that is missing&mdash;all that
is so well known, the obvious as it passes before every
chronicler, the ceremony, the faith, and the action
which do not apparently affect the movements of civilisation,
but which make up the personal, religious and
political life of the people. It is always well to bear in
mind that the historical records preserved from the past
must necessarily be incomplete. An accident preserves
one, and an accident destroys another. An incident
strikes one historian, and is of no interest to another.
And it may well be that the lost document, the unrecorded
incident, is of far more value to later ages
than what has been preserved. This condition of historical
research is always present to the scientific
student, though it is not always brought to bear upon
the results of historical scholarship.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the scope of
the historian is gradually but surely widening. It is
no longer possible to shut the door to geography,
ethnography, economics, sociology, arch&aelig;ology, and
the attendant studies if the historian desires to work his
subject out to the full.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is even getting to be
admitted that an appeal must be made to folklore,
though the extent and the method are not understood.
After all that can be obtained from other realms of
knowledge, it is seen that there is a large gap left still&mdash;a
gap in the heart of things, a gap waiting to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
filled by all that can be learned about the thought,
ideas, beliefs, conceptions, and aspirations of the
people which have been translated for them, but not
by them, in the laws, institutions, and religion which
find their way so easily into history.</p>

<p>The necessities of folklore are far greater than and
of a different kind from those of history. Edmund
Spenser wrote three centuries ago "by these old
customs the descent of nations can only be proved
where other monuments of writings are not remayning,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and yet the descent of nations is still being
proved without the aid of folklore. It is certain that
the appeal will not be made to its fullest extent unless
the folklorist makes it clear that it will be answered in
a fashion which commands attention. It appears to
me that the preliminary conditions for such an appeal
must be ascertained from the folklore side. History
has not only justified its existence, but during the long
period of years during which it has been a specific
branch of learning it has shown its capacity for proceeding
on strictly scientific and ever-widening lines. Folklore
has neither had a long period for its study nor a
completely satisfactory record of scientific work. It is,
therefore, essential that folklore should establish its
right to a place among the historical sciences. At
present that right is not admitted. It is objected to by
scholars who will not admit that history can proceed
from anything but a dated and certified document, and
by a few who do not admit that history has anything
to do with affairs that do not emanate from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
prominent political or military personages of each period.
It is silently, if not contemptuously ignored by almost
every historical inquirer whose attention has not been
specially directed to the evidence contained in traditional
material. Thus between the difficulties arising
from the interpretation of texts which, originating in
oral tradition, have by reason of their early record
become literature, and the difficulties arising from the
objections of historians to accept any evidence that is
not strictly historical in the form they assume to be
historical, traditional material has not been extensively
used as history. It has also been wrongly defined by
historians. Thus, to give a pertinent example, so good
a scholar as Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Stevenson, in his admirable
edition of Asser's <i>Life of King Alfred</i>, lays to the
crimes of tradition an error which is due to other
causes. Indeed, he states the cause of the error
correctly, but does not see that he is contradicting
himself in so doing. It is worth quoting this case.
It has to do with the identification of "Cynuit," a place
where the Danes obtained a victory over the English
forces, and Kenwith Castle in Devonshire has been
claimed as the site of the struggle and "a place known
as Bloody Corner in Northam is traditionally regarded
as the scene of a duel between two of the chieftains in
877, and a monument recording the battle has been
erected."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Stevenson's comment upon this is:
"We have in this an instructive example of the worthlessness
of 'tradition' which is here, as so frequently
happens elsewhere, the outcome of the dreams of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
local antiquaries, whose identifications become gradually
impressed upon the memory of the inhabitants;"
and he then proceeds to show that this particular tradition
was produced by the suggestion of Mr. R.&nbsp;S.
Vidal in 1804. Of course, the answer of the folklorist
to this charge against the value of tradition is that the
example is not a case of tradition<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at all. On the contrary,
it is a case of false history, started by the local
antiquary, adopted by the scholars of the day, perpetuated
by the government in its ordnance survey of
the district, and kept alive in the minds of the people
not by tradition but by a duly certified monument
erected for the express purpose of commemorating the
invented incident. There is then no tradition in any
one of the stages through which the episode has
passed. It is all history and false history. Historians
cannot shake off their responsibilities by looking upon
the local antiquary as the responsible author of tradition.
They cannot but admit that the local antiquary belongs
to the historical school, even though he is not a fully
equipped member of his craft, and because he blunders
they must not class him as a folklorist. They must bring
better evidence than this to show the worthlessness of
tradition. In the meantime it is the constant definition
of tradition as worthless, the relegation of worthless
history "to the realms of folklore,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which does so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
much harm to the study of folklore as a science.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Because the historian misnames an historical error as
tradition, or fails to discover, at the moment he
requires it, the fact which lies hidden in tradition, he
must not dismiss the whole realm of tradition as useless
for historical purposes.</p>

<p>Let us freely admit that the historian is not altogether
to blame for his neglect and for his ignorance of tradition
as historical material. He has nothing very definite
to work upon. Even the great work of Grimm is
open to the criticism that it does not <i>prove</i> the antiquity
of popular custom and belief&mdash;it merely states the
proposition, and then relies for proof upon the accumulation
of an enormous number of examples and the
almost entire impossibility of suggesting any other
origin than that of antiquity for such a mass of non-Christian
material. Then the great work of Grimm,
ethnographical in its methods, has never been followed
up by similar work for other countries. The philosophy
of folklore has taken up almost all the time of our
scholars and students, and the contribution it makes to
the history of the civilised races has not been made out
by folklorists themselves. It does not appear to me
to be difficult to make out such a claim if only scientific
methods are adopted, and the solution of definite problems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
is attempted;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and if too the difficulties in the
way of proof are freely admitted, and where they
become insuperable, the attempt at proof is frankly
abandoned. I believe that every single item of folklore,
every folk-tale, every tradition, every custom and superstition,
has its origin in some definite fact in the
history of man; but I am ready to concede that the
definite fact is not always traceable, that it sometimes
goes so far back as to defy recognition, that it sometimes
relates to events which have no place in the
after-history of peoples who have taken a position
on the earth's surface, and which, in the prehistory
stage, belong to humanity rather than to peoples.
Folklore, too, is governed by its own laws and rules
which are not the laws and rules of history. These
concessions, however, do not mean the introduction
of the term "impossible" to our studies. They
mean rather a plea for the steady and systematic
study of our material, on the ground that it has
much to yield to the historian of man, and to
the historians of races, of peoples, of nations, and of
countries.</p>

<br />
</p>

<p>We cannot, however, show that this is so without
facing many difficulties created for the most
part by folklorists themselves. In the first place
it is necessary to overtake some of the earlier conclusions
of the great masters of our science. The
first rush, after the discovery of the mine, led to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>the vortex created by the school of comparative mythologists,
who limited their comparison to the myths
of Aryan-speaking people, who absolutely ignored the
evidence of custom, rite, and belief, and who could see
nothing beyond interpretations of the sun, dawn,
and sky gods in the parallel stories they were the
first to discover and value. We need not ignore all
this work, nor need we be ungrateful to the pioneers
who executed it. It was necessary that their view
should be stated, and it is satisfactory that it was
stated at a time early in the existence of our science,
because it is possible to clear it all away, or as much of
it as is necessary, without undue interference with the
material of which it is composed.</p>

<p>The school of comparative mythologists did not,
however, entirely control the early progress of the
study of folklore. There was always a school who
believed in the foundation of myth being derived from
the facts of life. Thus Dr. Tylor, in a remarkable
study of historical traditions and myths of observation,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
long ago noted that many of the traditions current
among mankind were historical in origin. Writing
nearly forty years ago, he had to submit to the influence,
then at its height, of Adalbert Kuhn and Max
M&uuml;ller, and he conceded that there were many traditions
which were fictional myths. I think this concession
must now be much more narrowly scrutinised, and
preparation made for the conclusion that every genuine
myth is a myth of observation, the observation by men
in a primitive state of culture, of a fact which had
struck home to their minds. The question is, to what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
part of human history does the central fact appertain?
Here is undoubtedly a most difficult problem. What
the student has to do is to admit the difficulty, and to
state, if necessary, that the fact preserved by tradition
is not in all cases possible to discover with our present
knowledge. This is a perfectly tenable position.
Human imagination cannot invent anything that is
outside of fact. It may, and of course too frequently
does, misinterpret facts. In attempting to explain and
account for such facts with insufficient knowledge, it
gets far away from the truth, but this misinterpretation
of fact must not be confused with the fact itself. In a
word, it must be borne in mind by the student of tradition
that every tradition which has assumed the form
of saga, myth, or story contains two perfectly independent
elements&mdash;the fact upon which it is founded, and
the interpretation of the fact which its founders have
attempted.</p>

<p>There is further than this. The other branch of
traditional material, namely that relating to custom,
belief, and rite, rests upon a solid basis of historic fact;
customs which are strange and irrational to this age are
not in consequence to be considered the mere worthless
following of practices which owe their origin to accident
or freak; beliefs which do not belong to the established
religion are not in consequence to be considered as
mere superstition; rites which were not established
by authority are not in consequence to be classed as
mere specimens of popular ignorance. But the difficulties
in the way of getting all this accepted by the
historian are many, and, again, not a few of them are the
creation of the folklorist himself. Not only has he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
neglected to classify and arrange the scattered items of
custom, belief, and rite, and to ascertain the degree of
association which the scattered items have with each
other, but he has set about the far more difficult and
complex task of comparative study without having
previously prepared his material.</p>

<p>The historian and the folklorist are thus brought
face to face with what is expected from both, in order
that each may work alongside of the other, using each
other's materials and conclusions at the right moment
and in the right places. The folklorist has the most to
do to get his results ready, and to explain and secure
his position. He has been wandering about in a
somewhat inconsequential fashion, bent upon finding
a <i>mythos</i> where he should have sought for a <i>persona</i>
or a <i>locus</i>, engaged in an extensive quest after parallels
when he should have been preparing his own material
for the process of comparative science, seeking for
origins amidst human error when he should have
turned to human experience. He has to change all
this waywardness for systematic study, and this will
lead him in the first place to disengage from the results
hitherto obtained those which may be accepted and
which may form the starting-point for future work.
But his greatest task will be the reconsideration of
former results and the rewriting of much that has
been written on the wrong lines, and when this is
done we shall have the historian and folklorist meeting
together in the spirit which Edmund Spenser
so finely and truly described three centuries ago in
his treatment of Irish history: "I do herein rely
upon those bards or Irish chronicles ... but unto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
them besides I add mine own reading and out of them
both together with comparison of times likewise of
manners and customs, affinity of words and manner,
properties of natures and uses, resemblances of rites
and ceremonies, monuments of churches and tombs
and many other like circumstances I do gather a likelihood
of truth, not certainly affirming anything, but by
conferring of times language monuments and such like
I do hunt out a probability of things which I leave to
your judgment to believe or refuse."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>I shall of course not be able to undertake either
of these tasks. I shall attempt, however, to indicate
their scope and importance; and as a preliminary to
the consideration of the definite departments into which
the subject falls, it is advisable, I think, to test the
relationship of tradition to history by means of one
or two illustrations. It may be that the illustrations I
shall give are not accepted by all students, that some
better illustration is forthcoming by further research.
This is one of the drawbacks from which tradition
suffers, and must suffer, until our studies are much
further advanced than they are at present. But I am
glad to accept this possibility of error as part of the
case for the study of tradition, because the error of one
student cannot be held to disqualify the whole subject.
It only amounts to saying that the particular fact which
seems to me to be discoverable in the examples dealt
with has to be surrendered in favour of another particular
fact. My conclusions may be dismissed, but
that which is not dismissible is the discoverable fact,
and it is only when the true fact is discovered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
each traditional item that previous inferences may be

<h4>I</h4>

<p>The evidence of historic events which enter into
tradition relates principally to the earliest periods, but
much of it relates to periods well within the domain
of history and yet reveals facts which history has either
hopelessly neglected or misinterpreted. We shall find
that these facts, though frequently relating to minor
events, often have reference to matters of the highest
national importance, and perhaps nowhere more
definitely is this the case than in the legends connected
with particular localities. Of one such tradition
I will state what a somewhat detailed examination
tells in this direction. It will, I think, serve as a
good example of the kind of research that is required
in each case, and it will illustrate in a rather special
manner the value of these traditions to history.</p>

<p>The <i>locus</i> of the legend centres round London
Bridge. The earliest written version of this legend is
quoted from the MSS. of Sir Roger Twysden, who
obtained it from "Sir William Dugdale, of Blyth Hall,
in Warwickshire, in a letter dated 29th January,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
1652-3." Sir William says of it that "it was the
tradition of the inhabitants as it was told me there,"
and Sir Roger Twysden adds of it that: "I have since
learnt from others to be most true." This, therefore, is
a very respectable origin for the legend, and I will
transcribe it from Sir William Dugdale's letter which
begins "the story of the Pedlar of Swaffham-market is
in substance this":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That dreaming one night if he went to London he
should certainly meet with a man on London Bridge which
would tell him good news he was so perplext in his mind
that till he set upon his journey he could have no rest; to
London therefore he hasts and walk'd upon the Bridge for
some hours where being espyed by a shopkeeper and asked
what he wanted he answered you may well ask me that question
for truly (quoth he) I am come hither upon a very vain
errand and so told the story of his dream which occasioned
the journey. Whereupon the shopkeeper reply'd alas good
friend should I have heeded dreams I might have proved
myself as very a fool as thou hast, for 'tis not long since that
I dreamt that at a place called Swaffham Market in Norfolk
dwells one John Chapman a pedlar who hath a tree in his
backside under which is buried a pot of money. Now therefore
if I should have made a journey thither to day for such
hidden treasure judge you whether I should not have been
counted a fool. To whom the pedlar cunningly said yes verily
I will therefore return home and follow my business not heeding
such dreams hence forward. But when he came home
being satisfied that his dream was fulfilled he took occasion to
dig in that place and accordingly found a large pot of money
which he prudently conceal'd putting the pot amongst the
rest of his brass. After a time it happen'd that one who
came to his house and beholding the pot observed an inscription
upon it which being in Latin he interpreted it that under
that there was an other twice as good. Of this inscription the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
Pedlar was before ignorant or at least minded it not but when
he heard the meaning of it he said 'tis very true in the shop
where I bought this pot stood another under it which was
twice as big; but considering that it might tend to his further
profit to dig deeper in the same place where he found that he
fell again to work and discover'd such a pot as was intimated
by the inscription full of old coins: notwithstanding all which
he so conceal'd his wealth that the neighbours took no notice
of it."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>Blomefield thought it "somewhat surprising to find
such considerable persons as Sir William Dugdale
and Sir Roger Twysden to patronise or credit such a
monkish legend and tradition savouring so much of
the cloister, and that the townsmen and neighbourhood
should also believe it," but I think we shall have
reason to congratulate ourselves that so good a folk-tale
was preserved for us of this age.</p>

<p>The next and, it appears, an independent version, is
given in the <i>Diary of Abraham de la Pryme</i>, under the
date November 10th, 1699:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Constant tradition says that there lived in former times,
in Soffham (Swaffham), <i>alias</i> Sopham, in Norfolk, a certain
pedlar, who dreamed that if he went to London bridge, and
stood there, he should hear very joyfull newse, which he at
first sleighted, but afterwards, his dream being dubled and
trebled upon him, he resolv'd to try the issue of it, and
accordingly went to London, and stood on the bridge there
two or three days, looking about him, but heard nothing
that might yield him any comfort. At last it happen'd that
a shopkeeper there, hard by, haveing noted his fruitless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked
any almes, went to him and most earnestly begged to know
what he wanted there, or what his business was; to which
the pedlar honestly answer'd, that he had dream'd that if he
came to London and stood there upon the bridg, he should
hear good newse; at which the shopkeeper laught heartily,
asking him if he was such a fool as to take a journey on
such a silly errand, adding, 'I'll tell thee, country fellow,
last night I dream'd that I was at Sopham, in Norfolk, a
place utterly unknown to me, where methought behind a
pedlar's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak
tree, if I digged I should find a vast treasure! Now think
you,' says he, 'that I am such a fool to take such a long
jorney upon me upon the instigation of a silly dream? No,
no, I'm wiser. Therefore, good fellow, learn witt of me,
and get you home, and mind your business.' The pedlar,
observeing his words, what he had sayd he had dream'd and
knowing they concenterd in him, glad of such joyfull newse
went speedily home, and digged and found a prodigious
great treasure, with which he grew exceeding rich, and
Soffham church being for the most part fal'n down he set
on workmen and reedifyd it most sumptuously, at his own
charges; and to this day there is his statue therein, cut in
stone, with his pack at his back, and his dogg at his heels;
and his memory is also preserved by the same form or
picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, and ale-houses
of that town unto this day."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>Now this version from Abraham de la Pryme was
certainly obtained from local sources, and it shows the
general popularity of the legend, together with the
faithfulness of the traditional version.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
evidence of the traditional force of the story is to be
found. Observing that De la Pryme's <i>Diary</i> was not
printed until 1870, though certainly the MS. had been
lent to antiquaries, it is curious that the following
almost identical account is told in the <i>St. James's
Chronicle</i> of November 28th, 1786:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A Pedlar who lived many Years ago at Swaffham, in
Norfolk, dreamt, that if he came up to London, and stood
upon the Bridge, he should hear very joyful News; which he
at first slighted, but afterwards his Dream being doubled
and trebled unto him, he resolved to try the Issue of it; and
accordingly to London he came, and stood on the Bridge for
two or three Days, but heard nothing which might give him
Comfort that the Profits of his Journey would be equal to
his Pains. At last it so happened, that a Shopkeeper there,
having noted his fruitless standing, seeing that he neither
sold any Wares, or asked any Alms, went to him, and
enquired his Business; to which the Pedlar made Answer,
that being a Countryman, he had dreamt a Dream, that if he
came up to London, he should hear good News: 'And art
thou (said the Shopkeeper) such a Fool, to take a Journey
on such a foolish Errand? Why I tell thee this&mdash;last Night
I dreamt, that I was at Swaffham, in Norfolk, a Place
utterly unknown to me, where, methought, behind a Pedlar's
House, in a certain Orchard, under a great Oak Tree, if I
digged there, I should find a mighty Mass of Treasure.
Now think you, that I am so unwise, as to take so long a
Journey upon me, only by the Instigation of a foolish Dream!
No, no, far be such Folly from me; therefore, honest
Countryman, I advise thee to make haste Home again, and
do not spend thy precious Time in the Expectation of the
Event of an idle Dream.' The Pedlar, who noted well his
Words, glad of such joyful News, went speedily Home, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
digged under the Oak, where he found a very large Heap of
Money; with Part of which, the Church being then lately
fallen down, he very sumptuously rebuilt it; having his
Statue cut therein, in Stone, with his Pack on his Back and
his Dog at his Heels, which is to be seen at this Day. And
his Memory is also preserved by the same Form, or Picture,
on most of the Glass Windows of the Taverns and Ale-houses
in that Town."</p></div>

<p>The differences in these versions are sufficient to
show independent origin. The identities are sufficient
to illustrate, in a rather remarkable manner, how closely
the words of the tradition were always followed. It
appears from the last words of the contributor to the
<i>St. James's Chronicle</i>, who signed himself "Z," that
he heard it by word of mouth about the time of his
writing it down,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> so that there is more than a hundred
years between him and the Dugdale version, which was
also recorded from "constant tradition."</p>

<p>In Glyde's <i>Norfolk Garland</i> (p. 69), is an account of
this legend, but with a variant of one incident. The
box containing the treasure had a Latin inscription on
the lid, which John Chapman could not decipher. He
put the lid in his window, and very soon he heard
some youths turn the Latin sentence into English:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Under me doth lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another much richer than I."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And he went to work digging deeper than before,
and found a much richer treasure than the former.
Another version of this rhyme is found in <i>Transactions</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
<i>of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society</i> (iii. 318) as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where this stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is another as good."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And both these versions are given by Blomefield.</p>

<p>Now if there were no other places besides Swaffham in
Norfolk to which this legend is applied the interest in it
would, of course, not be very great. But there are many
other places, and we will first note those in Britain.
The best is from Upsall, in Yorkshire, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Many years ago there resided, in the village of Upsall,
a man who dreamed three nights successively that if he went
to London Bridge he would hear of something greatly to his
advantage. He went, travelling the whole distance from
Upsall to London on foot; arrived there, he took his station
on the bridge, where he waited until his patience was nearly
exhausted, and the idea that he had acted a very foolish part
began to rise in his mind. At length he was accosted by a
Quaker, who kindly inquired what he was waiting there so
long for? After some hesitation, he told his dreams. The
Quaker laughed at his simplicity, and told him that <i>he</i> had
had last night a very curious dream himself, which was, that
if he went and dug under a certain bush in Upsall Castle, in
Yorkshire, he would find a pot of gold; but he did not know
where Upsall was, and inquired of the countryman if he knew,
who, seeing some advantage in secrecy, pleaded ignorance
of the locality, and then, thinking his business in London
was completed, returned immediately home, dug beneath the
bush, and there he found a pot filled with gold, and on the
cover an inscription in a language which he did not understand.
The pot and cover were, however, preserved at the
village inn, where one day a bearded stranger like a Jew,
made his appearance, saw the pot, and read the inscription on
the cover, the plain English of which was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0bq">"'Look lower, where this stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0bq">Is another twice as good.'<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
The man of Upsall hearing this resumed his spade, returned
to the bush, dug deeper, and found another pot filled with
gold, far more valuable than the first. Encouraged by this
discovery, he dug deeper still, and found another yet more
valuable.</p>

<p>"This is the constant tradition of the neighbourhood, and
the identical bush yet exists (or did in 1860) beneath which
the treasure was found; a burtree, or elder, <i>Sambucus nigra</i>,
near the north-west corner of the ruins of the old castle."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>It would be tedious to go through other English
versions,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but I must point out that it is connected
with a London district. This is shown not by the
actual presence of the legend, which has died out in
London, but by its representation in the parish church
of Lambeth. The legend so strongly current at Swaffham,
in Norfolk, is represented in the church in the
shape of a carving in wood of a figure to represent the
pedlar, and below him the figure of what is locally
called a dog.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> A comparison of this carving with the
representation of the pedlar's window formerly existing
in Lambeth Church, but which was sacrilegiously removed
in 1884 by the late vicar of the parish, shows much
the same general characteristics, and search among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>parish books shows it to relate to a pedlar known by the
name of Dog Smith, who left property still known by the
name of the "Pedlar's Acre" to the parish.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> All this
suggests that we have here the last relics of the pedlar
legend located in London.</p>

<p>The next stage in the history of this legend shows it
to belong to the world's collection of folk-tales. There
is, however, a preliminary fact of great significance to
note, namely that two non-British versions refer to
London Bridge. Thus a Breton tale refers to London
Bridge, and the interest of this story is sufficiently
great to quote it here from its recorder straight from
the Breton folk:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Long ago, when the timbers of the most ancient of the
vessels of Brest were not yet acorns, there were two men in
a farmhouse in the C&ocirc;tes du Nord disputing, and they were
disputing about London Bridge. One said it was the most
beautiful sight in the world, while the other very truly said,
'No! the grace of the good God was more beautiful still.'
And as the dispute went on, 'Let us,' said one of them,
'settle it once and for all, and in this way: let us now this
moment go out along the high-road and let us ask the first
three men we meet as to which is the most beautiful&mdash;London
Bridge or the grace of the good God? And which ever way
they decide, he who holds the beaten opinion shall lose to
the other all his possessions, farm and cattle and horses,
everything.' So each being confident he was right, they
went out: and the first man they met declared that though
the grace of the good God was beautiful, London Bridge was
more beautiful still; and the second the same, and the third.
And the man whose opinion was beaten, a rich farmer, gave
up all he had and was a beggar.</p>

<p>"'Now,' said he to himself when the other, taking his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
horse by the bridle, had left him&mdash;'now let me go and see this
London Bridge which is so wonderfully beautiful;' and,
being very manful and stout, he set out at once to walk, and
walking on and on was there by nightfall. But, good
Christian that he was, he could see in it nothing to shake his
belief that the grace of the good God was more beautiful
still.</p>

<p>"Soon the bridge was silent, and the last to cross it had
gone home; and he, notwithstanding his losses, tired out
and sleepy, lay down and fell into a doze there; and, while
he was dozing, there came by two men, and one of them, standing
quite close by him, said to the other, 'The night is fine,
the wind gentle, the stars clear! On such a night whoever
were to collect the dew would be able to heal the blind.'
'It is true,' answered the other; 'but none know of it.' And
they passed on, quietly as they had come. Thereupon up
rose the beggared farmer, and with basin and cup set about
collecting the dew; and in a very short time performed with
it the most wonderful cures; finally curing the daughter of a
neighbouring Emperor who had been blind from her birth,
and whom her grateful father gave to him at once in
marriage, since directly she set eyes on him she loved
him."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<p>The second non-British variant, which also attaches
to London Bridge, is to be found in the <i>Heimskringla</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and I will quote William Morris's translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"West in Valland was a man infirm so that he was a
cripple and went on knees and knuckles. On a day he was
abroad on the way and was asleep there. That dreamed he
that a man came to him glorious of aspect and asked
whither he was bound and the man named some town or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>other. So the glorious man spoke to him: Fare then to
Olaf's church the one that is in London and thou wilt be whole.
Thereafter he awoke, and fared to seek Olaf's church and at
last he came to London bridge and there asked the folk of
the city if they knew to tell him where was Olaf's church.
But they answered and said that there were many more
churches there than they might wot to what man they were
hallowed. But a little thereafter came a man to him who
asked whither he was bound and the cripple told him. And
sithence said that man: We twain shall fare both to the
church of Olaf for I know the way thither. Therewith they
fared over the bridge and went along the street which led to
Olaf's church. But when they came to the lich gate then
strode that one over the threshold of the gate but the cripple
rolled in over it and straightway rose up a whole man.
But when he looked around him his fellow farer was
vanished."</p></div>

<p>I shall have to refer again to these Breton and Norse
versions, because of their retention of London Bridge
as the locale of the story, in common with all the versions
which have been found in Britain. In the meantime
it is to be noted that the remaining non-British
variants are told of other bridges and other places.
Holland, Denmark, Italy, Cairo, have their representative
variants;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and it thus presents to the student of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
tradition an excellent example for inquiry as to the
value to history of legends world-wide in their distribution
attaching themselves to historical localities.</p>

<p>There are some obvious features about this group of
traditions, which at once lead to interesting questions.
There is first the fact that all the British variants of the
treasure stories centre round London Bridge; secondly,
there is the extension beyond Britain to the Breton
variant and the Norse variant, both non-British
legends, of which the <i>locus</i> is London Bridge. From
these two facts it is clear that London Bridge had
some special influence at a period of its history which
dates before the separation of the Breton folk from
their Celtic brethren in Britain, for the Bretons would
not after their separation acquire a London Bridge
tradition; and again at a period of its history when
Norse legend and saga were fashioning. In the one
case the myth-makers must have been Celts of the
fourth century, and the only bridge known to these
Celts must have been that belonging to Roman Lundinium;
in the other case the myth-makers were
Norsemen, and the bridge known to them was the
later bridge so frequently referred to in the chronicle
accounts of the Danish and Norse invasions of
England.</p>

<p>It is not difficult, by a joint appeal to history
and folklore, to trace out from this very definite
starting-point the events which brought about this
particular specialisation of the world-spread treasure
myths.</p>

<p>Obviously the first point to note is that London
Bridge loomed out greatly in the minds and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
understanding of people at two distinct periods of its history.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
That the first period relates to its building is suggested
by the date supplied by the evidence of the Breton
version. The people who wondered at its building,
or the results of its building, were certainly not the
builders themselves, and we thus see a distinction in
culture between the bridge builders and the wonder
builders. This condition is exactly provided for by
the building of the earliest London Bridge. It was a
work of the Romans of Lundinium,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the people
who stood in wonder at this great enterprise were not
the Roman engineers and builders, accustomed to such
undertakings all over the then known world, and they
must therefore have been the surrounding non-Roman
people, who were the Celtic tribesmen. Now the culture-antagonism
between the Romans of Lundinium and
the Celts of Britain is, I believe, a factor of great importance,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
though almost universally neglected by our
historians, because they do not study the facts of early
history on anthropological lines. Not only is it discoverable,
as I think, from the facts of history, but the
facts of tradition confirm the facts of history at all
points. Thus I think it is important, if we can, to
obtain independent testimony of the attitude of the
surrounding people to the builders of London Bridge.
We can do this by reference to the peasant beliefs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
concerning bridges, as, for instance, in Ireland, where
on passing over a bridge they invariably pulled off
their hats and prayed for the soul of the builder of the
bridge,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and to the fact that the Romans themselves
looked upon bridge-building as a sacred function, and
would no doubt use this part of their work to the
fullest extent, in order to impress the barbarism opposed
to them.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The extent of this impression may probably
be contained in the old and widely spread nursery
rhyme of "London Bridge is Broken Down," an
examination of which has led Mrs. Gomme to conclude
that it contains reference to an ancient belief that the
building of the bridge was accompanied by human
sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> This conclusion is confirmed by the preservation
in Wales of a bridge-sacrifice tradition. It
relates to the "Devil's Bridge" near Beddgelert.
"Many of the ignorant people of the neighbourhood
believe that this structure was formed by supernatural
agency. The devil proposed to the neighbouring inhabitants
that he would build them a bridge across the
pass, on condition that he should have the first who
went over it for his trouble. The bargain was made,
and the bridge appeared in its place, but the people
cheated the devil by dragging a dog to the spot and
whipping him over the bridge."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This is a distinct
trace of a substituted animal sacrifice for an original
human sacrifice. But this is a practice which sends
us back to the most primitive times, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
particular we are referred to an exact parallel in India,
where, on the governing English determining to build
a bridge of engineering proportions and strength
over the Hoogley River at Calcutta, the native Hindu
tribesmen immediately believed that the first requirement
would be a human sacrifice for the foundation.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The traditions attaching to London Bridge are therefore
identical with the current beliefs concerning the
Hoogley Bridge, and the culture-relationship of the
bridge-builders to the surrounding people in both cases
is that of an advanced civilisation to tribesmen. Now
if these conditions of modern India are repetitions
of the conditions of ancient Britain in the days of
Lundinium, and of this there can be but little doubt,
there is no difficulty in understanding to what part of
history these traditions have led us. We are again in
the days when London Bridge was a marvel&mdash;a marvel
which sent travelling through the Celtic homes of
Britain a new application of the treasure myth which they
had inherited from remote ancestors. The marvel lived
on through the ages when London was in the unique
position of being an undestroyed city in Saxon times,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
times which witnessed the destruction of all other cities
of Roman foundation,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and the sending forth of the
Celtic refugees to Brittany.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The accumulation during
a long-continuing period of conceptions of treasure being
found by way of the bridge leading to London, would
become the direct force for keeping the tradition alive;
and while the facts of history show us the important
position of London during the period which witnessed
the departure of the Celtic Bretons to their continental
home,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the facts of tradition show us the Celtic tribesmen
deeming it a way to wealth through the magic
potency of dreamland. The Celtic tribesmen stood
outside Roman Lundinium. Its life was not their life,
and their conversion of its position into a mythic
treasure house or a mythic road to treasure, and their
association of it with the bloody rites of the foundation
sacrifice, are in strict accord with the historical relationship
of the tribal life of Celtic Britain to the city life of
Roman Lundinium.</p>

<p>I may be permitted perhaps to emphasise this significant
accordance of history and tradition when working
together. I have already alluded to the fact that I
have worked out the history of London independently,
and upon lines quite different from the present study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
I have therefore a wider grasp of the two currents of
history and folklore in this particular case than could
in the ordinary way fall either to the historian or to the
folklorist. That I can find in both just the complementary
facts which help to realise the whole situation,
to fill in the gaps of history which nowhere directly
tells of the relationship of Roman Lundinium to the
British Celts, to extend the outlook of folklore which
nowhere recognises that there was a great Roman city
of Lundinium which would dominate the minds of
those not trained to city life, is a fortunate circumstance
which neither historian nor folklorist is likely to repeat
frequently, and I am entitled, I think, to claim the
utmost from it. I can at least claim that it answers all
the facts in a way that has not yet been accomplished.
Thus Sir John Rhys has discussed the treasure legend
and he can only account for it as part of the mythical
trappings of Arthur into which "London Bridge is
introduced," because London Bridge "formerly loomed
very large in the popular imagination as one of the
chief wonders of London." Sir John Rhys refers for
confirmation of this to the "notion cherished as to
London and London Bridge by the country people of
Wales even within my own memory," and then goes on
to say that "the fashion of selecting London Bridge as
the opening scene of a treasure legend had been set
perhaps by a widely spread English story," that of the
Pedlar of Swaffham.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> All this is very unsatisfactory.
Modern notions of this sort would not set the fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
two centuries ago, nor extend it to Brittany. Nor is
the suggestion in accord with other evidence as to the
extension of tradition. What has happened is that the
Arthur cycle has appropriated two London Bridge
traditions and has worked them up into the Arthur
form, the traditions themselves belonging to the far
older period to which I have here referred them&mdash;a
period when the burial of treasure was a necessary
corollary to the events which were happening.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Buried
treasure legends are found all over the country. They
belong to the period of conquest and fighting. They
are the evidence which tradition yields of the unrest of
the times which caused them to arise. They are the
fragments of history which tradition has preserved,
while history has coldly passed them by.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
With this in the background as the <i>corpus</i> of a
legend-covered London Bridge, we come to the second
period.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
London Bridge to the Norsemen of the tenth and
eleventh centuries was a place of fierce fighting and
struggle, a place of victory and death. The saga
takes pains to describe this wondrous bridge<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> before
it describes the great fight there and its capture by
King Olaf, a fight which produced a war-rhyme which,
in Laing's version, begins with the same words as the
English nursery rhyme, "London Bridge is broken
down!"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and which Morris renders as a tribute to
King Olaf, "thou brakest down London Bridge."
There is little wonder, then, that the men of King Olaf
took back with them to saga-land a great memory of
this bridge and this fight, transferred to it their own
variant of the world-wide treasure legend, and made
a legend not of money treasure, but of regained health
to a crippled warrior. The corresponding non-British
version of Brittany helps us to understand that the
cure of disease was originally associated with the gains
of treasure, and in the Norse version the treasure incident
is altogether dropped, but in its place is the
recovery of health, a treasure more in accord with the
sterner needs and recollections of a great fight. The
Norse story is helpful to us as showing how London
Bridge could enter into the legends of a people, and
remain with them even after that people was no longer
living in Britain, and it becomes therefore a valuable
addition to the evidence for the more ancient transference
from Britain to Brittany of the original legend.</p>

<p>Altogether the piecing together of the items of historical
value in this legend is most complete. We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
not only recovered for history hitherto lost conceptions
of the place held by Roman Lundinium among the Celtic
tribesmen, but we have recovered also evidence of
the true culture-position of the Celtic tribesmen towards
their Roman conquerors. The examination of this
legend may have been long and tedious, but the result
is, I think, commensurate. It illustrates the power of
tradition to set historical data in their proper environment,
to restore the proportion which they bear to unrecorded
history, and if the student will but follow the
evidence carefully, I think he will find these results.</p>

<p>We will take a step forward, and turn from local to
personal attachments of tradition. There is a whole
class of traditions attached to personages about whose
historical existence there can be but little doubt, and
just because of the accretion of tradition round them
their historical existence has oftentimes been denied.
The most famous example in our history is of course
King Arthur, and so great an authority as Sir John
Rhys is obliged to resort to a special argument to account
for the problems he is faced with. He argues, and
argues strongly, for an historic Arthur&mdash;an Arthur who
was the British successor of the Roman emperor after
Britain had ceased to be a part of the Roman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
But because of the myths which have grown round
him, he suggests that there must also have been "a
Brythonic divinity named Arthur," and we are thus
introduced to a dual study of history and myth which
does not appear to me to take us very far, and which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
in fact, just separates history from myth, instead of
showing where they join hands. This dual conception
of myth is indeed a rather favourite resort of those
scholars who cannot appreciate the evidence that
proves a character in a mythic tradition to be an actual
historical personage. It is the basis of the famous
Sigfried-Arminius controversy. It does duty in many
less important cases,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and most frequently in connection
with northern mythology, where the line between
mythic and historical events gathering round a hero is
generally so finely drawn as to be almost imperceptible.
But it is so obviously a piece of special pleading on
self-created lines that other explanation is needed. And
another explanation is to be obtained if only students
will rely upon the evidence of tradition itself instead
of appealing to every fancy derived from sources which
have nothing to do with tradition.</p>

<p>The history of King Arthur has been the subject of
inquiry too frequently for it to be possible in these
pages to discuss the dual theory as it has been applied
to him, but I will attempt to show that it is quite
unnecessary thus to explain the history of King Arthur
by turning to the history of another of our great heroic
figures, one of the greatest to my mind, who, like
Arthur, has secured not only a fair share of special
tradition belonging to himself personally, but a larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
share than others of that corpus of tradition which has
descended from our earliest unknown ancestors, and
become attached to the historical hero of later times&mdash;I
mean, Hereward, the last of the Saxon defenders of his
land against William the Norman.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The analysis of the
Hereward legend affords a good example of the process
by which tradition is preserved by historical fact, and in
its turn helps to unravel the real history which lies at
the source. Instead, therefore, of attempting to travel
over the voluminous literature which is the outcome of
the King Arthur story, I will use for the same purpose
the shorter story of Hereward the Englishman.</p>

<p>We start with the fact that Hereward is unknown to
history until his great stand in the Island of Ely
against the might of William, the conqueror of England.
And yet to the banners of this "unknown"
chieftain there flocked the discontented heroism of
England, men ranking from the noble to the peasant,
and including such great figures as Morcar, Edwine,
and Waltheof. I always think, too, that the little band
of Berkshire men, who started across the country to
join Hereward in the fens, and were intercepted and
cut to pieces by a Norman troop,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> give us more than
a passing glimpse at the estimation in which Hereward
was held by his countrymen. Such a man commanding
so much, in face of so much, could not have been
the unknown person which history makes him.</p>

<p>How then can we ascertain why he was held in such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
estimation? History being quite silent, tradition
steps into the gap. It is the tradition recorded in post-Herewardian
times, be it noted. In this great body of
tradition, contained in a Latin MS. of the twelfth
century, he journeys to Scotland, where he slew a bear
and saved the people whom it had oppressed; from
thence to Cornwall, where he fought and slew a great
champion, the lover of the princess; from thence to
Ireland, where he assisted the King in war, and back
again to Cornwall to rescue again the princess from
a distasteful wooer, and, finally, to Flanders. Even in
the camp of the Norman, which he visits in traditional
fashion, he has an adventure with witches which takes
us to the worship of wells. Much of his adventure
is but the application of well-known traditional events,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and it is important to note that the geography of
the supposed travels belongs to the very home of
tradition, the unknown territories of the Celts, Ireland,
Cornwall, and Scotland.</p>

<p>Now all this tradition is certainly not true of Hereward.
But what it does is to certify to his greatness in
the eyes of his countrymen, to show that his countrymen
were anxious to explain why he was so great in
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1070, and why before that date he was unknown
to them. This is an important point to have gained.
It shows the vacuum which was occupied by tradition
because contemporary, or nearly contemporary,
thought required it to be filled up. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
popular mind abhors a vacuum as much as the
material world of nature does. It will fill it with its
own conceptions, if it cannot fill it with recognised
facts. Hereward must have been a famous man when
he took his stand in the fens of Ely. That his biographers
explain his fame by the application of ancient
traditions is only saying that his countrymen reckoned
his fame as of the very highest; ordinary current events
of the day would not suit their ideas of the fitness of
things. Hereward was as Alfred had been, as Arthur
had been, and so he must have his share of the national
tradition, even as these heroes had. To say less of
him was to have put him below the others. And
history in this case could not help, for it was in the
hands of Hereward's enemies, and they were careful to
say nothing or very little of English heroes at this
period. The great battle of Hastings had been lost,
but of all the English men who had fought and died
there we only know of three names beyond those of the
king and his house. Leofric the abbot of Peterborough,
Godric the sheriff of Berkshire, and Asgar
the sheriff of London, have become known by accident,
as it were. All others are unnamed and unhonoured.
Therefore, when the great deeds of Hereward came to
be chronicled, it was not enough to say he was at
Hastings; the deeds of old must be chronicled of him
as they had been chronicled of others.</p>

<p>This accretion of popular tradition to account for the
fame of Hereward when he took command at Ely,
though it proclaims in the strongest terms that Hereward
was famous in the eyes of his countrymen, displaces
history therefore. Putting the case in this way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
we may proceed to examine what recorded history
exactly has to say of Hereward, and then by noting
what it has left unsaid, we may perhaps be able to fill
the gap by a reasonable deduction from the facts. In
Domesday there are clearly two Herewards, one having
lands in Lincolnshire in the time of King Edward and
<i>not</i> at the date of the survey, the other having lands in
Warwickshire in the time of King Edward and <i>also</i>
at the date of the survey. Here we have two widely
different counties and two widely different conditions,
and it is right with all the evidence to conclude that
they relate to different personages. The Lincolnshire
Hereward is the hero of the fens. He held of the
abbot of Peterborough, and Ulfcytil, who was appointed
in 1062, was the abbot in question. This
brings us to only four years before the battle of Hastings,
and another entry in Domesday, thanks to the
scholarship of Mr. Round, proves that Hereward
was deprived of his Lincolnshire lands not before but
after the great fights at Hastings and in the fens.
Therefore the story shapes itself somewhat in this
fashion. Hereward was in England in 1062. He was
then a man of the abbot of Peterborough; that is to
say, a tenant bound to perform military service to his
lord. His lord, the abbot, was at Hastings with his
tenants, and fought there. That Hereward of all the
abbot's tenants should have followed his lord to
Hastings is more than likely; the strange thing would
be that he should not have done so. That going
thither nameless among the many, he should gain
experience under Harold, though no fame has come to
him through the historians from a field where Saxon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
fame was buried; that his own genius should make
him use his experience when need arose; that among
the English all survivors from that field who were still
unwilling to bow the knee to William would be
reckoned as heroes by their depressed countrymen;
that on this account alone he would be given rank
above Morcar, who had kept away from Hastings&mdash;are
the conclusions to be drawn legitimately from the
silence as well as the actual records of history, compared
with the story told by tradition. History and
tradition are in accord, not in conflict; the gaps of
history are filled by tradition&mdash;that tradition which was
suitable and worthy of so great a hero, namely the
ancient tradition told of all heroes. Reopening these
gaps and putting in its right place the tradition which
had hitherto prevented them from being seen, we are
able to appeal to history to yield up the true story of
one of the greatest of English heroes, a story which
shows him to have been at Hastings by the side of
Harold, to have won fame there, to have continued the
fight for English liberty as leader of the English
patriots, and to have earned a place in the unsung
English epic.</p>

<p>But his place in English tradition helps us to understand
the value and position of tradition in such cases.
The traditions clustering round the name of Hereward
do not compel us to interpret them as Hereward facts.
The historian, however, need not on this account fear
for Hereward. He should rather value the traditions
as evidence of the greatness of the English hero among
the conquered English. They applied to him the
legends of their oldest heroes. All that was delightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
to them in tradition was attached to their present hero.
He was worthy of a place among their greatest. And
thus the fact of added tradition brings out the estimate
of the worth of the hero to those among whom he lived
and for whom he fought.</p>

<p>The traditions themselves belong to far other times,
and the facts contained in them must be interpreted from
the oldest ideas of our race. It is only by thus disengaging
the traditions which have grown round the
historical person that the correct interpretation of the
position can be attempted, and when that is done we
are left, not with a mass of uncertain and misleading
testimony about a national hero, but with certain definite
historical facts belonging to Hereward, and certain
traditions attached to Hereward, certifying to his
great place in the popular estimation, telling of facts
which do not, it is true, belong to Hereward, but which,
in a special sense, belong to the people who were
reverencing Hereward.</p>

<p>If I have made it clear from these examples that the
explanation of historic fact and mythic tradition in
combination does not lead either to the discrediting of
history or to the creation of new mythic realms, I
need not dwell much longer on this class of illustrations
of the relationship between history and tradition. Over
and over again, in the local records, are examples to be
found where history is in close contact with tradition,
and I am far more inclined to question the evidence
which proves the falseness of any authenticated tradition
than I am to trust all the statements which do duty
for history. It is not only the traditions looming largely
in popular interest, but some of the smallest local<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
traditions which throw light on great historical events.
They may tell us not merely of the great historical
event, but of the peculiar relationship of parts of the
kingdom to that event, which no purely historical evidence
could by any possibility explain. One of the most
striking examples is, perhaps, the Sussex tradition of
"Duke" William as a conqueror.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The title Duke is
here faithfully recorded of the great conqueror, who
everywhere else in England, both in historical documents
and in the popular language, is referred to as
king. The explanation is, if the identification of this
tradition with the great Norman king is correct, that
Sussex being more or less separated from the rest of
the country by its great weald, carried its own tradition
of the bloody field at Hastings sufficiently long and
uninterrupted for it to be stamped upon the minds of
the people in its original form, and thus to remain. No
better evidence could be found for the relationship of
Sussex to this great event. All the chapters in Mr.
Freeman's great history do not impress the imagination
so strongly as this one fact, that William the Conqueror
has always been Duke William to the Sussex folk. He
was Duke William to the fen folk, too. They fought
for their belief and were compelled to accept his kingship.
The Sussex folk fought, too, and they handed
down their conception of the great fight to their children.</p>

<p>A good example of a slightly different kind occurs
in connection with Kett's rebellion in Norfolk. It
was associated with a prophecy that said, "there
shulde lande at Walborne hope the proudest prince of
Christendome, and so shall come to Moshold heethe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
and there shuld mete with other ij kinges, and shall
fyght and shalbe put down: and the whyte lyon shuld
optayne" the mastery. And yet this prophecy goes
much further back, for the Danes are said to have
landed at Weybourne Hope in their invasions, and the
old <ins class="correction" title="'ryhme' in original">rhyme</ins>
is still remembered in the county:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He that would England win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must at Weybourn Hope begin."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is an example of the forcible revival of an ancient
tradition to suit a later fact, and is evidence of the
enormous impression which the event to which it refers
had upon the locality. Kett's rebellion was one thing
to the nation at large and quite another thing to this
district of Norfolk, and the great events of the tenth
century preserved in legend were equated with the
minor events of the sixteenth century, thus enabling
us to understand better the depth of the local feeling
which produced these events.</p>

<p>Both local and personal traditions are of interest in
the unravelling of the meaning of historical events, and
the forces at the back of them, and I will add a note of
one or two examples of those humbler traditions which
confirm or enhance the value of the historical record.
They are of the greatest importance if correctly understood.
They include such examples, for instance, as
Mr. Kemble notes when he says, "I have more than
once walked, ridden, or rowed, as land and stream
required, round the bounds of Anglo-Saxon estates, and
have learned with astonishment that the names recorded
in my charter were those still used by the woodcutter or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>the shepherd of the neighbourhood."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is remarkable
testimony to the persistence of tradition. It is the
commencing point of a whole series of examples which
go to show that embedded in the memories of the
people, and supported by no other force but tradition,
there are innumerable traces of historic fact.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>A stage forward, in the same class of tradition, are
those examples of special names which indicate an
important or impressive event, the real nature of
which is only revealed by modern discovery. Thus
perhaps the "White Horse Stone" at Aylesford, in
Kent, the legend of which is that one who rode a
beast of this description was killed on or about this
spot,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> may take us back to the great battle at Crayford,
where Horsa was killed. Another kind of local tradition
is perhaps more instructive. Immediately contiguous
to the north side of the Roman road at
Litlington, near Royston, were some strips of unenclosed,
but cultivated, land, which in ancient deeds
from time immemorial had been called "Heaven's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
Walls." Traditional awe attached to this spot, and
the village children were afraid to traverse it after dark,
when it was said to be frequented by supernatural
beings. Here is subject for inquiry. Both words
in the name are significant. Why the allusion to
Heaven; why is a field called walls? The problem
was solved in 1821, for in that year some labourers
were digging for gravel on this spot, and they struck
upon an old wall composed of flint and Roman brick.
This accidental discovery was followed up by Dr.
Webb, and the wall was found to enclose a rectangular
space measuring about thirty-eight yards by twenty-seven,
and containing numerous deposits of sepulchral
urns containing ashes of the dead. It was clear
from the results of the excavations that here was
one of those large plots of ground environed by
walls to which the name of <i>ustrinum</i> was given
by the Romans,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a fact which was preserved in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>name long after the site had lost every trace of its
origin.</p>

</p>

<p>I will refer to one more local example. In Dorsetshire
and Wiltshire fairs are held upon sites which
are often marked by the remains of ancient works, or
distinguished by some dim tradition of vanished importance.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
One has only to refer to the history of the
market as "a contribution to the early history of
human intercourse" as Mr. Grierson puts it,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and to
the extremely important and archaic constitution of the
market, a glimpse of which has been afforded by Sir
Henry Maine, alone among scholars who have investigated
earliest English institutions, to know how
valuable such a note as this must be if it can be confirmed
by extended research. Local investigation of
these places and their traditions would, no doubt, lead
to many points in the tribal settlement of the district,
an important fact of history nowhere found in history.</p>

<p>No one, I think, taking into consideration this view<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
of the relationship of local and personal traditions to
history will deny that history is likely to gain much by
the proper interpretation of such traditions. Every
yard of British territory has its historic interest, and
there are innumerable peaks above the general level
which should be worth much to national history. Every
epoch of British history has its great personage, who
in popular opinion stands out from among his fellows.
When once it is understood that traditions attaching to
places and persons yield facts of a kind worth searching
for, there will arise the desire to obtain all that is now
obtainable from this source, and to add thereto the
deductions to be drawn from their geographical distribution.</p>

<p>If the accretion of myth around the lives of great
historic personages, and the persistence of tradition
in historic localities, may be accepted as one phase
of the necessary relationship of tradition to history,
we may proceed to inquire how far the unattached
traditions, the folk-tales pure and simple, contain
or are based upon historic details. These details
will not tell us of any one historic personage, or relate
to any one historic locality, but will relate to
the peoples before personages and localities figured
in their history, and will explain facts in culture-history
rather than in political history. We shall be
approaching the period before written history had
begun, and for which, so far as written history is
concerned, we are dependent upon foreign or outside
authority. I think, perhaps, Dr. Karl Pearson has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
put the case for this view in the best form. "As we
read fairy stories to our children," he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"we may study history for ourselves. No longer oppressed
with the unreal and the <i>baroque</i>, we may see primitive human
customs and the life of primitive man and woman cropping
out at almost every sentence of the nursery tale.
Written history tells us little of these things, they must
be learnt, so to speak, from the mouths of babes. But
there they are in the <i>M&auml;rchen</i>, as invaluable fossils for those
who will stoop to pick them up and study them. Back in
the far past we can build up the life of our ancestry&mdash;the
little kingdom, the queen or her daughter as king maker,
the simple life of the royal household, and the humble candidate
for the kingship, the priestess with her control of the
weather and her power over youth and maid. In the dimmest
distance we can see traces of the earlier kindred group
marriage, and in the near foreground the beginnings of that
fight with patriarchal institutions which led the priestess to
be branded by the new Christian civilization as the evil-working
witch of the Middle Ages."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></div>

<p>I should not have ventured to quote this long passage
if my own studies, before Dr. Pearson's book
was published in 1897, had not led me to much the
same conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But Dr. Pearson assists me in
a special way. His methods are scientific. He is
not a folklorist because he loves folklore, but because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
he sees in it the materials for elucidating the early life
of man. He is not, so to speak, prejudiced in its
favour. He brings to his aid the practical mind of
the statistician and the psychologist, and his conclusions
may not, therefore, be put on one side as easily
as those of myself and other students of folklore.</p>

<p>It is due to the folklorist, however, to say that
this aspect of the folk-tale had already been discovered
by one of the greatest of the earlier collectors of
traditional lore, the late Mr. J.&nbsp;F. Campbell. Thus,
writing, in 1860, of his grand collection of "Highland
Tales," Mr. Campbell very truly says: "The
tales represent the actual everyday life of those who
tell them, with great fidelity. They have done the
same, in all likelihood, time out of mind, and that which
is not true of the present is, in all probability, true of
the past; and therefore something may be learned of
forgotten ways of life."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Readers of Mr. Campbell's
books well know how he has traced out from these traditions
from the nursery, identical customs with Highland
everyday life, and relics also of a long-forgotten past
state of things; how he points to the records of the
stone age and the iron age in these representatives of
the scientific memoirs of the past; how very significantly
he answers his own supposition, that if these
tales "are dim recollections of savage times and savage
people, then other magic gear, the property of giants,
fairies, and bogles, should resemble things which are
precious now amongst savage or half-civilized tribes, or
which really have been prized amongst the old inhabitants
of these islands or of other parts of the world."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
This is an extremely important conclusion on the
relationship of history and tradition, and it will be well
to illustrate it by turning to some obvious details of
primitive life, which are to be seen with more or less
clearness enshrined in the folk-tales which have been
preserved in our own country.</p>

<p>In Kennedy's <i>Fireside Stories of Ireland</i>, it is related
in one of the tales that there was no window to the mud-wall
cabin, and the door was turned to the north;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and then, again, we have this picture given to us in
another story: on a common that had in the middle of
it a rock or great pile of stones overgrown with furze
bushes, there was a dwelling-house, and a cow-house,
and a goat's-house, and a pigsty all scooped out
of the rock; and the cows were going into the byre,
and the goats into their house, but the pigs were grunting
and bawling before the door.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> This takes us to the
surroundings of the cave-dwelling people.</p>

<p>Then in other places we come across relics of ancient
agricultural life preserved in these stories. In the Irish
story of "Hairy Rouchy" the heroine is fastened by
her wicked sisters in a pound,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> an incident not mentioned
in the parallel Highland tale related by Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Many Irish stories contain details of primitive life that
the Scottish variants do not contain. The field that
was partly cultivated with corn and partly pasture for
the cow,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the grassy ridge upon which the princess
sat, and the furrows wherein her two brothers were
lying,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> are instances.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
A great question arises here. If the Scotch story does
not mention the primitive incident mentioned in the Irish
story, does it mean that the Irish story has retained for
a longer time the details of its primitive original? Or
does it mean that it has absorbed more of surrounding
Irish life into it than the Scotch story has of surrounding
Scottish life?</p>

<p>These details must have a place in the elucidation
of Irish folk-tales, because they have a very distinct
place indeed in primitive institutions; and it hence
becomes a question to folklorists as to how they have
entered into, or escaped from, the narrative of traditional
story. It appears to me that the appearance
or non-appearance of these phases of early life are
typical of what has been going on with the plot
and structure of folk-tales as long as they have remained
the traditional treasures of the people. A
story identical in all the main outlines of plot will be
varied in matters of detail, according to the people who
are using it in their daily routine of story-telling. But
this variation is always from the primitive to the
cultured, from the simple to the complex. The mud-cabin
or cave-dwelling in Irish story would have developed
into the palace in stories of a richer country like
England; the old woman, young girl, master and servant,
would become perhaps the queen, princess, king
and vassal; just as in Spanish and Portuguese stories
the giant of other European tales is represented by
"the Moor." If this process of change is a factor
in the life of the folk-tale, it follows that those folk-tales
which contain the greatest number of primitive
details are the most ancient, and come to us more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
directly from the prehistoric times which they represent.</p>

<p>We may gather warrant for such a conclusion if we
pass from small details to a distinct institution. The
institution which stands out most clearly in early history
is the tribe, and I will therefore turn to an element
of ancient tribal life, and an element which has to do
with the practical organisation of that life, namely, the
tribal assembly. We find that the folk-tale records
under its fairy or non-historic guise many important
recollections of the assembly of the tribe. One very
natural feature of this assembly in early times was its
custom of meeting in the open air&mdash;a custom which
in later times still obtained, for reasons which were
the outcome of the prejudices existing in favour of
keeping up old customs. These reasons are recorded
in the formula of Anglo-Saxon times, that meetings
should not be held in any building, lest magic might
have power over the members of the assembly.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Before turning to the tales of our own country, I will
first see whether savage and barbaric tales have recorded
anything on the subject, for their picture of the
tribal assembly, when revealed in the folk-tale, belongs
to the period which might have witnessed the making
of the story, and which certainly witnessed the tribal
organisation of the people as a living institution.
Dr. Callaway, in his <i>Nursery Tales and Traditions
of the Zulus</i>, relates a story of "the Girl-King."
"Where there are many young women," says the
story, "they assemble on the river where they live,
and appoint a chief over the young women, that no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
young woman may assume to act for herself. Well,
then they assemble and ask each other, 'Which among
the damsels is fit to be chief and reign well?' They
make many inquiries; one after another is nominated
and rejected, until at length they agree together to
appoint one, saying, 'Yes, so and so shall reign.'"<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
However far this may be actually separated from the
political assembly of the Zulus, there is no doubt we
have here a folk-tale adaptation of events which were
happening around the relators of the tale. This is
all I am anxious to state, indeed. What in the folk-tale
was related of the girl-king, was a reflex only of
what happened when the political chieftain himself was
concerned.</p>

<p>This, perhaps, is still better illustrated if we turn to
India. In the story of "How the Three Clever Men
outwitted the Demons," told by Miss Frere in her <i>Old
Deccan Days</i>, it is related how "a demon was compelled
to bring treasure to the pundit's house, and on
being asked why he had been so long away, answered,
'All my fellow-demons detained me, and would hardly
let me go, they were so angry at my bringing you so
much treasury; and though I told them how great and
powerful you are, they would not believe me, but will,
as soon as I return, judge me in solemn council for
serving you.' 'Where is your council held?' asked
the pundit. 'Oh! very far, far away,' answered the
demon, 'in the depths of the jungle, where our rajah
daily holds his court.' The three men, the pundit, the
wrestler, and the pearl-shooter, are taken by the demon
to witness the trial.... They reached the great jungle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
where the durbar (council) was to be held, and there he
(the demon) placed them on the top of a high tree just
over the demon rajah's throne. In a few minutes they
heard a rustling noise, and thousands and thousands of
demons filled the place, covering the ground as far as
the eye could reach, and thronging chiefly round the
rajah's throne."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>A classical story told by &AElig;lian gives us another interesting
example of this feature of early political life.
It is said of the Lady Rhodopis, who was alike fair and
frail, that of all the beautiful women in Egypt, she was
by far the most beautiful; and the story goes that one
time when she was bathing, Fortune, which always was
a lover of whatever may be the most unlikely and unexpected,
bestowed upon her rank and dignity that
were alone suitable for her transcendent charms; and
this was the way what I am now going to tell came to
pass. Rhodopis, before taking a bath, had given her
robes in charge to her attendants; but at the same time
there was an eagle flying over the bath, and it darted
down and flew away with one of her slippers. The
eagle flew away, and away, and away, until it got
to the city of Memphis, where the Prince Psammetichus
was sitting in the open air, and administering
justice to those subject to his sway; and as the eagle
flew over him it let the slipper fall from its beak, and it
fell down into the lap of Psammetichus. The prince
looked at the slipper, and the more he looked at it, the
more he marvelled at the beauty of the material and the
dainty minuteness of its size; and then he cogitated
upon the wondrous way in which such a thing was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
conveyed to him through the air by a bird; and then it was
he sent forth a proclamation to all parts of Egypt to try
to discover the woman to whom the slipper belonged,
and solemnly promised that whoever she might be he
would make her his bride.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>A very beautiful legend, which has been preserved
by the Rev. W.&nbsp;S. Lach-Szyrma,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> carries into its fairy
narrative more of the realities of tribal life. Mr. Lach-Szyrma
obtained it from a peasant's chap-book, but it
professes to be an ancient Slovac folk-tale:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An orphan girl is left with a cruel stepmother, who
has a daughter who is bad-tempered and disagreeable,
and extremely jealous of her. She becomes the
Cinderella of the house, is ill-treated and beaten, but
submits patiently. At last the harsh stepmother is
urged by her daughter to get rid of her. It is winter,
in the month of January; the snow has fallen, and the
ground is frozen. The cruel stepmother in this dreadful
weather bids the poor girl to go out in the forest,
and not to come back till she brings some violets with
her. After many entreaties for mercy the orphan is
driven out, and goes out in the snow on the hopeless
errand. As she enters the forest she sees a little way
on in the deep glade, under the leafless trees, a large
fire burning. As she draws near she perceives around
the fire are twelve stones, and on the stones sit twelve
men. The chief of them, sitting on the largest stone,
is an old man with a long snowy beard, and a great
staff in his hand. As she comes up to the fire the old
man asks her what she wants. She respectfully replies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>by telling them, with many tears, her sad story. The
old man comforts her. 'I am January; I cannot give
you any violets, but brother March can.' So he turns
to a fine young man near him and says, 'Brother
March, sit in my place.' Presently the air around
grows softer. The snows around the fire melt. The
green grass appears, the flower-buds are to be seen.
At the orphan girl's feet a bed of violets appear. She
stoops and plucks a beautiful bouquet, which she brings
home to her astounded stepmother."</p>

<p>How clearly this is a representation of the tribal
assembly worked into the folk-tale, where January
and the months are the tribal chiefs, may be illustrated
by a comparison with the actual events of Indian tribal
life. Within the stockaded village of Supar-Punji, in
Bengal, are two or three hundred monuments, large
and small, all formed of circular, solid stone slabs, supported
by upright stones, set on end, which enclose the
space below. On these the villagers sit on occasions
of state, each on his own stool, large or small, according
to his rank in the commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Now evidence such as this, showing how the folk-tale
among primitive people gets framed according to the
social conditions within which it originates, will help
us to realise the peculiar value of similar features
which may be found in the folk-tales of our own country.
English tales are nearly destitute of such illustrations
of primitive tribal life as this. Some of the giant
stories of Cornwall, such as that relating to the loose,
uncut stones in the district of Lanyon Quoit, on whose
tors "they do say the giants sit,"<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> may refer to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
tribal assembly place, but it is shorn of all its necessary
details, and we do not get many examples even in this
shortened form.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, too, we find but little mention in
the Scotch tales of the open-air gatherings of the tribe.
The following quotation may refer to the custom perhaps,
but it is not conclusive: "On the day when
O'Donull came out to hold right and justice...."
(there were twelve men with him).<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Another story
is more exact. Mr. Campbell took it down from a
fisherman in Barra (ii. 137). The hero-child Conall
tends the sheep of a widow with whom he lodged.
"To feed these sheep he broke down the dykes which
guarded the neighbours' fields. The neighbours made
complaint to the king, and asked for justice. The king
gave foolish judgment, whereat his neck was turned
awry, and the judgment-seat kicked. Conall gave a
correct decision and released the king. He did this a
second time, and the people said he must have king's
blood in him." This allusion to the kicking of the
judgment-seat is a very instructive illustration of tribal
chieftainship and comes within that branch of the
subject with which we are now dealing.</p>

<p>But when we pass from Britain to Ireland, there is
at once a great storehouse of examples to be given.
In Dr. Joyce's <i>Old Celtic Romances</i> there are some
remarkable passages, which give us a good picture of
the assemblies of primitive times. These passages, it
should be noted, occur quite incidentally during the
course of the story&mdash;they belong to the same era as the
fairy-legend, the giant, and the witch, and taken as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>types of what was going on everywhere in prehistoric
times, they tell us much that is very valuable.</p>

</p>

<p>A great fair-meeting was held by the King of Ireland,
Nuada of the Silver Hand, on the Hill of Usna.
Not long had the people been assembled, when they
beheld a stately band of warriors, all mounted on white
steeds, coming towards them from the east, and at
their head rode a young champion, tall and comely.
"This young warrior was Luga of the Long Arms....
This troop came forward to where the King of Erin
sat surrounded by the Dedannans, and both parties
exchanged friendly greetings. A short time after this
they saw another company approaching, quite unlike
the first, for they were grim and surly-looking; namely,
the tax-gatherers of the Fomorians, to the number of
nine nines, who were coming to demand their yearly
tribute from the men of Erin. When they reached the
place where the king sat, the entire assembly&mdash;the
king himself among the rest&mdash;rose up before them."
Here, without following the story further, the assembling
in arms, the payment of the tributes at the council-hill,
the sitting of the king and his assembly, are all
significant elements of the primitive assembly. In a
later part of the same story we have "the Great Plain
of the Assembly" mentioned (p. 48). Another graphic
picture is given a little later on, when the warrior Luga,
above mentioned, demands justice upon the slayers of
his father, at the great council on Tara hill. Luga
asked the king that the chain of silence should be
shaken; and when it was shaken, when all were
listening in silence, he stood up and made his plea,
which ended in the eric-fine being imposed upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
three children of Turenn, the accomplishment of which
forms the basis of the fairy-tale which follows (p. 54).
Then, in another place in the same tale, when the
brothers are on their adventurous journey, fulfilling
their eric-fine, they come to the house of the King of
Sigar; and it "happened that the king was holding
a fair-meeting on the broad, level green before the
palace."</p>

<p>In another story the hero Maildun asks the island
queen how she passes her life, and the reply is,
"The good king who formerly ruled over this
island was my husband. He died after a long reign,
and as he left no son, I now reign, the sole ruler
of the island. And every day I go to the Great
Plain, to administer justice and to decide causes
among my people."</p>

<p>The beginning of another story is&mdash;"Once upon
a time, a noble, warlike king ruled over Lochlann,
whose name was Colga of the Hard Weapons. On
a certain occasion, this king held a meeting of his chief
people, on the broad, green plain before his palace of
Berva. And when they were all gathered together,
he spoke to them in a loud, clear voice, from where he
sat high on his throne; and he asked them whether
they found any fault with the manner in which he ruled
them, and whether they knew of anything deserving
of blame in him as their sovereign lord and king.
They replied, as if with the voice of one man, that they
found no fault of any kind."</p>

<p>The last example is also a valuable one. A dispute
has occurred respecting the enchanted horse, the Gilla
Dacker, and "a meeting was called on the green to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
hear the award." Speeches are made and the awards
are given.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>I think it will be admitted that the folk-tales of Britain
refer back in such cases to the organisation of the tribe
in early times, and the only possible conclusion to be
drawn from this fact is that they too belong to early
times and that they have brought with them to modern
days these valuable fragments of history which are
hardly to be discovered in any other historical document.</p>

<p>We have thus shown that the folk-tale contains many
fragmentary details of ancient social conditions, and
further that it contains more than mere details in the
larger place it assigns to important features of tribal
institutions. It now remains to see whether apart from
incident the very structure and heart of the folk-tale
is founded upon conceptions of life. I will take as an
example the well-known story of Catskin. This story
contains one remarkable feature running through many
of the variants, and a second which is found in practically
all of them. Both these features are perfectly
impossible to modern creative fancy, and I venture to
think we shall find their true origin in the actual facts
of primitive life, not in the wondrous flight of primitive
fancy.</p>

<p>The opening incidents of "Catskin" are thus related:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A certain king, having lost his wife, and mourned
for her even more than other men do, suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
determines, by way of relieving his sorrows, to marry his
own daughter. The princess obtains a suspension of
this odious purpose by requiring from him three beautiful
dresses, which take a long time to prepare. These
dresses are a robe of the colour of the sky, a robe of
the colour of the moon, a third robe of the colour of
the sun, the latter being embroidered with the rubies
and diamonds of his crown. The three dresses being
made and presented to her, the princess is checkmated,
and accordingly asks for something even more valuable
in its way. The king has an ass that produces gold coins
in profusion every day of his life. This ass the princess
asked might be sacrificed, in order that she might have
his skin. This desire even was granted. The princess,
thus defeated altogether, puts on the ass's skin, rubs
her face over with soot, and runs away. She takes a
situation with a farmer's wife to tend the sheep and
turkeys of the farm."</p>

<p>The remainder of the story much resembles Cinderella's
famous adventures, and I need not repeat it
here. The pith of the story turns upon the fact that a
father purposes to marry his own daughter, or, in some
versions, his daughter-in-law; and the daughter,
naturally, as we say, objecting to this arrangement,
runs away, and hence her many adventures. This
famous story, told by English nurses to English
children, long before literature stepped across the
sacred precincts of the nursery, is also told in Ireland
and Scotland. It is also current in France,
Italy, Germany, Russia, Lithuania, and many other
nations; and throughout all these versions, differing,
of course, in some matters of detail, the selfsame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
incident is observable&mdash;the father wishing to
marry his own daughter, and the daughter running
away.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This incident, therefore, must be older than the
several nations who have preserved it from their
common home, where the tale was originally told with
a special value that is now lost. It must then belong
to primitive man, and not to civilised man, and must be
judged by the standard of morals belonging to primitive
man. It is not sufficient, or, indeed, in any way to
the point, to say that the idea of marrying one's own
daughter is horrible and detestable to modern ideas;
we must place ourselves in a position to judge of
such a state of affairs from an altogether different
standpoint. And what do we find in primitive society?
We find that women were the property, not the help-mates,
of their husbands. And the question hence
arises, in what relation did the children stand in respect
to their parents? The answer comes from almost all
parts of the primitive world that, in certain stages of
society, the children were related to their mother only.
It is worth while pausing one moment to give evidence
upon the fact. Thus McLennan says of the Australians,
"it is not in quarrels uncommon to find children of the
same father arrayed against one another, or indeed,
against their father himself; for by their peculiar law
<i>the father can never be a relative of his children</i>."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This
is not the language, though it is the evidence, of the
latest research, and another phase of it is represented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
by the custom, as among the Ahts of Vancouver Island,
that in case of separation while the children are
young, the children go always with the mother to their
own tribe.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Here we see that the relationship between father and
daughter was in no way considered in ancient society
of the type to which Australians and Ahts belonged,
and it is now one of the accepted facts of anthropology
that at certain stages of savage life fatherhood
was not recognised. That this non-relationship
of the father very often resulted in the further stage
of the father marrying his daughter, is exemplified by
many examples. The story of Lot and his daughters,
for instance, will at once occur to the reader, and
upon this Mr. Fenton has some observations, to
which I may refer the student who wishes to pursue
this curious subject further,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> while Mr. Frazer, in
his recent study of Adonis, has discussed the practice
with his usual extent of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Again, it should
be remembered that in our own chronicle histories
Vortigern is said to have married his own daughter,
though the legend and the supposed consequences of
the marriage have been twisted from their original
primitive surroundings by the monkish chroniclers,
through whom we obtain the story.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Turning next to the
daughter-in-law, supposing that the difference between
"daughter" and "daughter-in-law" (query stepdaughter)
in the story variants is a vital difference, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
not an accidental difference, there is curious and important
evidence from India. The following custom prevails
among certain classes of Sudras, particularly the
Vella-lahs in Koimbator: "A father marries a grown-up
girl eighteen or twenty years old to his son, a boy of
seven or eight, after which he publicly lives with his
daughter-in-law, until the youth attains his majority,
when his wife is made over to him, generally with half
a dozen children. These children are taught to address
him as their father. In several cases this woman
becomes the common wife of the father and son. She
pays every respect due to her wedded husband, and
takes great care of him from the time of her marriage.
The son, in his turn, hastens to celebrate the marriage
of his acquired son, with the usual pomps, ceremonies,
and tumasha, and keeps the bride for himself as his
father had done."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But even further than this, ancient
Hindu law allowed the father, who had no prospect of
having legitimate sons, to "appoint" or nominate a
daughter who should bear a son to himself, and not to
her own husband.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Sir Henry Maine gives the formula
for this remarkable appointment, and then goes on to
say that some customs akin to the Hindu usage of appointing
a daughter appear to have been very widely
diffused over the ancient world, and traces of them are
found far down in history.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>What we have before us, therefore, to guide us
in the view we take of the story incident of a father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
marrying his own daughter, may be summarised as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The father is not related to his daughter, and hence
examples occur of fathers marrying daughters.</p>

<p>2. The custom of marrying a daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>3. The custom of nominating a daughter to bear a
son.</p>

<p>From any one of these facts of primitive life we
arrive at the central incident in the story of Catskin:
the father could marry his daughter without specially
shocking the society of the primitive world, simply because,
according to primitive ideas, father and daughter,
as we call her, were not related.</p>

<p>We now arrive at the second incident&mdash;the running
away of Catskin. This again is a very early form of
marriage custom. Women of primitive times often
objected to the forced marriages, and they expressed
their objection very often by running away. In the instance
of Catskin the running away was successful,
as we all know; but in most instances the unwilling
bride was captured and forced to surrender. Mr.
Farrer, in his <i>Primitive Manners and Customs</i>, quite
clears the ground for the refutation of an argument
that might be applied if we did not know the customs
of primitive society. It might be asked, why did Catskin
run away if the custom was a usual one? For the
same reason, we answer, that the women of savage
society often do run away&mdash;objection to the marriage.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
Thus we have to note that the two principal features
of our ordinary Catskin story are explainable by a
reference to primitive manners and customs; and it
seems to me much easier and much more reasonable to
thus explain the origin of the Catskin story, than first
of all to create a "lovely myth," as the mythologists
would undoubtedly have a right to call it, of the Sun
pursuing the Dawn, and then to say that the Catskin
story is simply a relation of this myth.</p>

<p>The opening incident of the Catskin story, as thus
interpreted, is not an isolated case of the survival of
primitive marriage customs in popular stories. If it
were so, there would be considerable difficulty in
the way of supporting this interpretation. But it is
only saying of Catskin what can be said of other
stories. "There are traces," says Mr. Campbell,
speaking of his Highland stories, "of foreign or
forgotten laws and customs. A man buys a wife as
he would a cow, and acquires a right to shoot her,
which is acknowledged as good law."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Yes, this is
good savage law and custom there is no doubt, and
Lord Avebury and Mr. McLennan have illustrated
it by examples. But in the Highland story of the
"Battle of the Birds" the wife is sought to be purchased
for a hundred pounds (Campbell, i. 36), and in
the Irish story of the "Lazy Beauty and her Aunts"
we find something like bride-capture and purchase as
well.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> So, again, if we turn to India the same kind of
evidence is forthcoming of another part of the primitive
ceremony. "Do not think," retorted the Malee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
in a story collected by Miss Frere, "that I'll make
a fool of myself because I'm only a Malee, and
believe what you've got to say because you're a great
Rajah. If you mean what you say, if you care for my
daughter and wish to be married to her, come and be
married; but I'll have none of your new-fangled forms
and court ceremonies hard to be understood; let the
girl be married by her father's hearth, and under her
father's roof."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> And in another story of the "Chundun
Rajah" we have "the scattering rice and flowers
upon their heads;"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the significance of both of which
customs are fully known.</p>

<p>These illustrations of the contact, the necessary contact,
of tradition and history show that contact to be
equally true of the folk-tale as it is of the local or
personal legend. They all point to the substratum
of fact underlying tradition, to the absorption by
tradition of many features of the life by which it
is surrounded, or to the absorption by some great
historic person or event of the living tradition of
his time or place. This contact is a fact equally
important to history and to folklore. It cannot be
neglected by either. It stands for something in the
analysis which every student must give of the material
with which he is working, and that something has a
value, sometimes great and sometimes small, which
must influence the estimate of the material which both
history and folklore supply in the unravelling of man's
past.</p>

<p>I will now finally give a more complicated example
of the folk-tale as illustrative of the connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
between history and tradition. Mr. J.&nbsp;F. Campbell
printed a tale in the second volume of the <i>Transactions
of the Ethnological Society</i> (p. 336), which
had been sent to him in Gaelic by John Davan, in
December, 1862&mdash;that is, after the publication of the
fourth volume of his <i>Highland Tales</i>. The tale is
only in outline, but in quite sufficient fulness for my
present purpose, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a man at some time or other who was well
off, and had many children. When the family grew
up the man gave a well-stocked farm to each of his
children. When the man was old his wife died, and he
divided all that he had amongst his children, and lived
with them, turn about, in their houses. The sons and
daughters got tired of him and ungrateful, and tried to
get rid of him when he came to stay with them. At
last an old friend found him sitting tearful by the wayside,
and learning the cause of his distress, took him
home; there he gave him a bowl of gold and a lesson
which the old man learned and acted. When all the
ungrateful sons and daughters had gone to a preaching,
the old man went to a green knoll where his
grandchildren were at play, and pretending to hide, he
turned up a flat hearthstone in an old stance,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and
went out of sight. He spread out his gold on a big
stone in the sunlight, and he muttered, "Ye are
mouldy, ye are hoary, ye will be better for the sun."
The grandchildren came sneaking over the knoll, and
when they had seen and heard all that they were intended
to see and hear, they came running up with,
"Grandfather, what have you got there?" "That which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
concerns you not; touch it not," said the grandfather;
and he swept his gold into a bag and took it home to
his old friend. The grandchildren told what they had
seen, and henceforth the children strove who should
be kindest to the old grandfather. Still acting on the
counsel of his sagacious old chum, he got a stout little
black chest made, and carried it always with him.
When any one questioned him as to its contents, his
answer was, "That will be known when the chest is
opened." When he died he was buried with great
honour and ceremony, and then the chest was opened
by the expectant heirs. In it were found broken potsherds
and bits of slate, and a long-handled, white
wooden mallet with this legend on its head:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So am favioche fiorum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thabhavit gnoc annsa cheann,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Wright, in his collection of Latin stories, published
by the Percy Society in 1842 (pp. 28-29), gives a
variant of this tale under the title of "De divite qui
dedit omnia filio suo," and, so far as can be judged
by the abstract, the parallel between the two narratives,
separated by at least five centuries of time, is remarkably
close. The latter part is apparently different, for
the Latin version tells how the man pretended that the
chest contained a sum of money, part of which was to
be applied for the good of his soul, and the rest to
dispose of as he pleased. But at the point of death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
his children opened the chest. "Antequam totaliter
expiraret, ad cistam currentes nihil invenerunt nisi

<span class="i0">And goht hym self a beggyn.'"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here, then, is a case whereby to test the problem of
the position of folk-tales as historical material. Did the
people adopt this tale from literature into tradition and
keep it alive for five centuries; or did some early and
unconscious folklorist adapt it into literature? The
literary version has the flavour of its priestly influence,
which does not appear in the traditional version; and I
make the preliminary observation that if literature could
have so stamped itself upon the memory of the folk as
to have preserved all the essentials of such a story as
this, it must have been due to some academic influence
(of which, however, there is no evidence), and this
influence would have preserved a nearer likeness to
literary forms than the peasant's tale presents to us.
But the objection to this theory is best shown by an
analysis of the tale, and by some research into the
possible sources of its origin.</p>

<p>The story presents us with the following essential
incidents:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The gift of a well-stocked farm by a father to each
of his children.</p>

<p>2. The surrender of all property during the owner's
lifetime.</p>

<p>3. The living of the old father with each of his
children.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
4. The attempted killing of the old man.</p>

<p>5. The mallet bearing the inscription.</p>

<p>6. The rhyming formula of the inscription.</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell notes the first and third of these incidents
in his original abstract of the story,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but of the
remaining second, fourth, fifth, and sixth no note has
hitherto been taken.</p>

<p>Of the first incident, the gift of a well-stocked farm
by a father to each of his children, Mr. Campbell says:
"This subdivision of land by tenants is the dress and
declaration put on by a class who now tell this tale."
But it also represents an ancient system of swarming
off from the parent household when society was in a
tribal stage. The incident of the tale is exactly reproduced
in local custom. In the island of Skye the
possessor of a few acres of land cut them up only a few
years ago into shreds and patches to afford a separate
dwelling for each son and daughter who married.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In
Kinross, in 1797, the same practice prevailed. "Among
the feuars the parents are in many instances disposed
to relinquish and give up to their children their landed
possessions or the principal part of them, retaining
only for themselves some paltry pendicle or patch of
ground."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In Ireland and in Cornwall much the
same evidence is forthcoming, and elsewhere I have
taken some pains to show that these local customs are
the isolated survivals in late times of early tribal practices.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>We next turn to the second essential incident of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
tale&mdash;the surrender of the estate during the owner's
lifetime. This is a well-marked feature of early
custom, and Du Chaillu has preserved something
like the survival of the ritual observances connected
with it in his account of the Scandinavian practice.
On a visit to Husum he witnessed the ceremonial
which attended the immemorial custom of the farm
coming into possession of the eldest son, the father
still being alive. The following is Mr. Du Chaillu's
description, and the details are important: "The
dinner being ready, all the members of the family came
in and seated themselves around the board, the father
taking, as is customary, the head of the table. All at
once, Roar, who was not seated, came to his father and
said, 'Father, you are getting old; let me take your
place.' 'Oh, no, my son,' was the answer, 'I am not
too old to work; it is not yet time: wait awhile.'
Then, with an entreating look, Roar said, 'Oh, father,
all your children and myself are often sorry to see you
look so tired when the day's labour is over: the work
of the farm is too much for you; it is time for you to
rest and do nothing. Rest in your old age. Oh, let
me take your place at the head of the table.' All the
faces were now extremely sober, and tears were seen in
many eyes. 'Not yet, my son.' 'Oh, yes, father.'
Then said the whole family, 'Now it is time for you to
rest.' He rose, and Roar took his place, and was then
the master. His father, henceforth, would have nothing
to do, was to live in a comfortable house, and to
receive yearly a stipulated amount of grain or flour,
potatoes, milk, cheese, butter, meat, etc."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
stopping to analyse this singular ceremony in detail, it
is important to note that old age is the assigned cause
of resignation by the father of his estate; that the
ceremony is evidently based upon traditional forms,
the meaning of which is not distinctly comprehended
by the present performers; that the father is supported
by his successor. As a proof that we have
here a survival of very ancient practice, it may be
noticed that in Spiti, a part of the Punjab, an exact
parallel occurs. There the father retires from the headship
of the family when his eldest son is of full age,
and has taken unto himself a wife; on each estate there
is a kind of dower-house with a plot of land attached,
to which the father in these cases retires.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In Bavaria
and in W&uuml;rtemberg the same custom obtains,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and the
sagas of the North also confirm it as an ancient
custom.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Of the third incident in the tale, the living of the
father with his children, Mr. Campbell says this points
to the old Highland cluster of houses and to the farm
worked by several families in common,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and I think we
have here the explanation why the father in Scotland
did not have his "dower-house," as he did in Scandinavia
and in Spiti.</p>

<p>We next come to the fourth incident, the attempted
killing of the old father. Now, from some of the
earliest accounts of travels in Britain, we know that
the death of the aged by violence was a signal element
of the native customs. "They die only when they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
lived long enough; for when the aged men have made
good cheere and anoynted their bodies with sweet ointments
they leape off a certain rocke into the sea."
That we have in this episode of the story, remains of
customs which once existed in the North, Mr. Elton
affords proof, both from saga-history and from the
practice of later times, when "the Swedes and Pomeranians
killed their old people in the way which was
indicated by the passage quoted above."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It is the
custom of many savage tribes, and the observances
made use of are sometimes suggestive of the facts of
the tale we are now analysing. Thus, among the
Todas of the Nilgiri Hills, they place the old people in
large earthen jars with some food, and leave them to
perish;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> while among the Hottentots, Kolben says,
"when persons become unable to perform the least
office for themselves they are then placed in a solitary
hut at a considerable distance, with a small
stock of provisions within their reach, where they
are left to die of hunger, or be devoured by the wild
beasts."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The important bearing of these incidents of barbarous
and savage life upon our subject will be seen when
we pass on to our fifth incident, namely, the significant
use of the mallet. Some curious explanations have
been given of this. Mr. Thorns once thought it might
be identified with Malleus, the name of the Devil.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Nork has attempted with more reason to identify it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
with the hammer of Thor.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> But the real identification
is closer than this. Thus, it is connected with the
Valhalla practices, already noted, by the fact that if an
old Norseman becomes too frail to travel to the cliff, in
order to throw himself over, his kinsman would save
him the disgrace of dying "like a cow in the straw,"
and would beat him to death with the family club.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Mr. Elton, who quotes this passage, adds in a note
that one of the family clubs is still preserved at a farm
in East Gothland.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Aubrey has preserved an old English
"countrie story" of "the holy mawle, which (they
fancy) hung behind the church dore, which, when the
father was seaventie, the sonne might fetch to knock
his father in the head, as eff&oelig;te, &amp; of no more use."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
That Aubrey preserved a true tradition is proved by
what we learn of similar practices elsewhere. Thus, in
fifteenth-century MSS. of prose romances found in
English and also in Welsh, Sir Perceval, in his adventures
in quest of the Holy Grail, being at one time ill
at ease, congratulates himself that he is not like those
men of Wales, where sons pull their fathers out of bed
and kill them to save the disgrace of their dying in
bed.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Keysler cites several instances of this savage
custom in Prussia, and a Count Schulenberg rescued
an old man who was being beaten to death by his sons
at a place called Jammerholz, or "Woful Wood;"
while a Countess of Nansfield, in the fourteenth
century, is said to have saved the life of an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
man on the L&uuml;neberg Heath under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>Our investigation of barbarous and savage customs,
which connect themselves with the essential incidents of
this Highland tale, has at this point taken us outside the
framework of the story. The old father in the tale was
not killed by the mallet, but he is said to have used it
as a warning to others to stop the practice of giving up
their property during lifetime. We have already seen
that this practice was an actual custom in early times,
appearing in local survivals both in England and
Scotland. Therefore the story must have arisen at a
time when this practice was undergoing a change. We
must note, too, that the whole story leads up to the
finding of a mallet with the rhyming inscription written
thereon, connecting it with the instrument of death to
the aged, but only on certain conditions. If, then, we
can find that the rhyming inscription on the mallet has
an existence quite apart from the story, and if we can
find that mallets bearing such an inscription do actually
exist, we may fairly conclude that the story, which, in
Scotland, is the vehicle of transmission of the rhyme,
is of later origin than the rhyme itself.</p>

<p>First of all, it is to be noted under this head that
Wright, in a note to the Latin story we have already
quoted, gives from John of Bromyard's <i>Summa Predicantium</i>
another English version of the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wit this betel the smieth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And alle the worle thit wite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thevt the ungunde alle thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And goht him selve a beggyng,"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>which shows, I think, the popularity of the verse in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
vernacular. Clearly, then, the Latin version is a translation
of this, and not <i>vice <ins class="correction" title="'versa' in original">vers&acirc;</ins></i>.
It must have been a rhyming formula in the vernacular, which had a
life of its own quite outside its adoption into literature.</p>

<p>This inferential proof of the actual life of the English
rhyming formula is confirmed by actual facts in the case
of the corresponding German formula. Nork, in the
volume I have already quoted, collects evidence from
Grimm, Haupt, and others, which proves that sometimes
in front of a house, as at Osnabr&uuml;ck, and sometimes at
the city gate, as in several of the cities of Silesia and
Saxony, there hangs a mallet with this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wer den kindern gibt das Brod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Und selber dabei leidet Noth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Den schlagt mit dieser keule todt"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>which Mr. Thoms has Englished thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who to his children gives his bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thereby himself suffers need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this mallet strike him dead."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>These rhymes are the same as those in the Scottish
tale and its Latin analogue, and that they are preserved
on the selfsame instrument which is mentioned in the
story as bearing the inscription is proof enough, I
think, that the mallets and their rhyming formul&aelig; are
far older than the story. They are not mythical, the
story is; their history is contained in the facts we have
above detailed; the life of the folk-tale commences
when the use or formula of the mallet ceases to be part
of the social institutions.</p>

<p>To the rhyming formul&aelig;, then, I would trace the rise
of the mythic tale told by the Highland peasant in 1862<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
to Mr. J.&nbsp;F. Campbell. The old customs which we
have detailed as the true origin of the mallet, and its
hideous use in killing the aged and infirm, had died out,
but the symbol of them remained. To explain the
symbol a myth was created, which kept sufficiently
near to the original idea as to retain evidence of its
close connection with the descent of property; and thus
was launched the dateless, impersonal, unlocalised story
which Mr. Campbell has given as a specimen of vagrant
traditions, which "must have been invented after
agriculture and fixed habitations, after laws of property
and inheritance; but it may be as old as the lake-dwellings
of Switzerland, or Egyptian civilisation, or
Adam, whose sons tilled the earth."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> I would venture
to rewrite the last clause of this dictum of the great
master of folk-tales, and I would suggest that the
story, whatever its age as a story, tells us of facts in
the life of its earliest narrators which do not belong to
Teutonic or Celtic history. The Teuton and the Celt,
with their traditional reverence for parental authority,
at once patriarchal and priestly, would retain, with
singular clearness, the memory of traditions, or it may
be observations, of an altogether different set of ideas
which belonged to the race with which they first came
into contact. But whether the story is a mythic interpretation
by Celts of pre-Celtic practices, or a pre-Celtic
tradition, varied as soon as it became the
property of the Celt to suit Celtic ideas, it clearly takes
us back to practices very remote, to use Mr. Elton's
forcible words, from the reverence for the parents'
authority which might have perhaps been expected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
from descendants of "the Aryan household."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> These
practices lead us back to a period of savagery, of which
we have to speak in terms of race distinction if we
would get at its root.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The importance of such a conclusion
cannot be overrated, for it leads directly to the
issue which must be raised whenever an investigation
of tradition leaves us with materials, which are promptly
rejected as fragments of Celtic history because they are
too savage, but which need not therefore be rejected as
history, because they may be referred further back than
Celtic history.</p>

<p>If we proceed by more drastic methods, by the methods
of statistics, we shall arrive at much the same conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Taking the first twelve stories in Grimm's
great collection, we find that seven of them yield
elements which we are entitled to call savage, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
they are so far removed from the European culture
amidst which the folk-tales have lived, and because these
elements belong not to the accidentals of the stories but
to the essentials. Thus, if we divide the folk-tale into
its components, we shall find that it consists of three
features:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The story radicals, or essential plot;</p>

<p>2. The story accidentals, or illustrative points;</p>

<p>3. Modern gloss upon the events in the story&mdash;</p>

<p>and if we go on to allocate the various incidents of
the stories to these three heads, we get the following
common results with regard to seven out of the twelve
first stories of Grimm's great collection:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
There are thus savage elements in seven out of
twelve stories, and the question becomes an important
one as to how this is. They are the stories of the
nursery, told by mothers to children, stories kept alive
by tradition, and the only possible answer to our
question is that they contain fragments of the early
culture-history of the ancestors, or at all events the
predecessors, of those who have preserved them for our
use. An occasional savage incident might have been
considered a freak of the original narrator, or a borrowing
by one of the countless late narrators of these
stories brought home from savage countries; but
statistics disprove both of these suppositions. It is not
accidental but persistent savagery we meet with in
the folk-tale. It is also the savagery to be found
amongst modern peoples still in the savage stage of
culture.</p>

<p>This is proved in a very complete manner by Mr.
MacCulloch, whose study provides the material for a
statistical survey of story incidents founded on primitive
custom and belief.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> They are the most ancient
history to which we have access. That this history is
contained in the folk-tales of modern peasantry shows
it to have come from that far-off period which saw the
earliest condition of these people. It is still history, if
it tells us of a life which preceded the written record.
It is history of the most valuable description, for it
is to be found nowhere else as relating to the remotest
period of European civilisation. The modern savage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
is better off in this respect. He has an outside historian
in the traveller and the anthropologist of modern days.
The savage who was ancestor to our own people had
no such means of becoming known to history, or had
but very limited means, and it is only in the deathless
tradition that we can trace him out.</p>

<p>These conclusions have been drawn from that great
class of tradition preserved by historic peoples in
historic times, and yet unmistakably pointing to prehistoric
culture. We have been able to show the
methods to be adopted for, and the results of, disengaging
the myth which has gravitated to the
historic person or place from the historic facts which
have become part of the legend, and to trace out in the
folk-tale facts which belong to a culture far removed
from civilised life. There are thus revealed two
distinct centres of influence, the traditional centre and
the historic centre, and it is obvious that the question
must be asked&mdash;which is the more important? It seems
to me equally obvious that the answer must be given in
favour of the historic. History is indebted to tradition
for preserving some of the most remote facts of racial
or national life, which but for tradition would have
been lost, and if we are content to use this tradition
as a storehouse from which we may provide ourselves
with ancient historical documents, we can trace out
therefrom points in the history of any given country
wherever the traditions have been preserved.</p>

<p>The folk-tale, in point of fact, equally with the personal
and local legend, comes into close contact with history.
The periods of history in the folk-tales are different from
those in the legends, but together these periods reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
from prehistoric culture to historic event. We cannot,
however, call this extent of time a continuous period,
and we cannot point to definite stages within the
detached periods. Much more research must be accomplished
before it will be possible to claim such results
as these. I have indicated some points of difficulty,
some methods of treatment which appear to me to be
wrong, and to which I shall have again to refer later on;
but in the meantime, from the necessarily incomplete
evidence which I have been able to produce, it is, I
think, abundantly clear that folklore has to be studied
from its historical surroundings if we would draw from
it all that it is capable of telling.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>In the meantime it is well to bear in mind that there
is one important department of history which has
always been frankly and unhesitatingly accepted as
history and yet which has no stronger foundation than
tradition, and tradition of the most formal kind. I
allude to the early laws of most of the peoples who
have become possessed of an historic civilisation.
These laws have all been preserved by tradition, are in
rhyme or rhythm in order to assist the memory, have
become the sacred repository of a school or class of
priests, and have finally been reduced to writing by a
great lawgiver, who by the act of giving the people
written laws has had attributed to him supernatural
origin and powers. That history should have accepted
from tradition such an important section of its material
is worth consideration by itself, apart from its bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
on the present study, and I shall proceed, therefore, to
set out some of the chief facts in this connection.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in the tribal society of
Indo-European peoples the laws and rules which
governed the various members of the tribe were deemed
to be sacred and were preserved by tradition. The
opening clauses of the celebrated Laws of Manu illustrate
this position. "The great sages approached
Manu, who was seated with a collected mind, and
having worshipped him spoke as follows: Deign, divine
one, to declare to us precisely and in due order the
sacred laws of each of the four chief castes and of the
intermediate ones. For thou, O Lord, alone knowest
the purport, the rites, and the knowledge of the soul
taught in this whole ordinance of the self-existent
which is unknowable and unfathomable."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> They were
not only sacred in origin but they dealt with sacred
things, and Sir Henry Maine has drawn the broad
conclusion that "there is no system of recorded law,
literally from China to Peru, which, when it first
emerges into notice, is not seen to be entangled with
religious ritual and observance."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In Greece the lawgivers
were supposed to be divinely inspired, Min&ocirc;s
from Jupiter, Lykurgos from the Delphic god,
Zaleukos from Pallas.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The earliest notions of law
are connected with Themis the Goddess of Justice.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
Rome it is to Romulus himself that is attributed the
first positive law, and it is by a college of priests that
the laws were preserved.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In Scandinavia the laws
were in the custody and charge of the temple priests,
and the accumulated evidence for the sacred origin
and connection of the laws is to be found in the sagas.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Among the Celtic peoples it is well known that the
laws were preserved and administered by the Brehons,
who are compared with the Hindu Brahmins by Sir
Henry Maine, "with many of their characteristics
altered, and indeed, their whole sacerdotal authority
abstracted by the influence of Christianity."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In the
Isle of Man the laws were deemed sacred and known
only to the Deemsters.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>In all cases laws were preserved by tradition and not
by writing and evidence, and the superior value
attached to the traditional record appears everywhere.
The oldest record of Hindu law agrees with the best
authority that it was not founded on writing but
"upon immemorial customs which existed prior to and
independent of Brahminism."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In Greece the very
nature of the <i>themistes</i> shows that they were judgments
dependent upon traditional custom. In Rome it is the
subject of definite research that the "greater part of
Roman law was founded on the <i>mores majorum</i>."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In
Scandinavia the law speaker was obliged to recite the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
whole law within the period to which the tenure of his
office was limited.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The Celtic laws are based upon
customs handed down from remote antiquity,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and late
down in English law it was admitted as a principle
that if oral declarations came into conflict with
written instruments the former had the more binding
authority.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>One of the means by which this sacred tradition was
preserved was through the medium of rhythm and
verse. Thus, as Sir Henry Maine explains,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The law book of Manu is in verse, and verse is one of
the expedients for lessening the burden which the memory
has to bear when writing is unknown or very little used. But
there is another expedient which serves the same object.
This is Aphorism or Proverb. Even now in our own country
much of popular wisdom is preserved either in old rhymes or
in old proverbs, and it is well ascertained that during the
middle ages much of law, and not a little of medicine, was preserved
among professions, not necessarily clerkly, by these
two agencies."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
In Greece the same word, <ins class="greek" title="nomos">&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#959;&#962;</ins>, was used for custom
and law as for song. The <ins class="greek" title="rh&ecirc;tra">&#8165;&#8053;&#964;&#961;&#945;</ins> (declared law) of

and appointing some person to be their law-singer
(<ins class="greek" title="nom&ocirc;dos">&#957;&#959;&#956;&#969;&#948;&#8057;&#962;</ins>), who is among them the declarer of the laws.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Sir Francis Palgrave, noticing the same characteristic
of Teutonic law, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It cannot be ascertained that any of the Teutonic nations
reduced their customs into writing, until the influence of increasing
civilisation rendered it expedient to depart from their
primeval usages; but an aid to the recollection was often
afforded as amongst the Britons, by poetry or by the condensation
of the maxim or principle in proverbial or antithetical
sentences like the Cymric triads. The marked alliteration of
the Anglo-Saxon laws is to be referred to the same cause,
and in the Frisic laws several passages are evidently written
in verse. From hence, also, may originate those quaint and
pithy rhymes in which the doctrines of the law of the old
time are not unfrequently recorded."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p></div>

<p>Again, the editors of the Brehon Law Tracts point
out that early laws are handed down "in a rhythmical
form; always in language condensed and antiquated
they assume the character of abrupt and sententious proverbs.
Collections of such sayings are found scattered
throughout the Brehon Law Tracts."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The sagas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
contain many verses which partake of the character of
legal formul&aelig;, and in Beowulf there seems to be a
definite example. It occurs in the passage describing
Beowulf engaged in his fatal combat with the fiery
dragon, when his "companions," stricken with terror,
deserted him, on which Wiglaf pronounced the following
malediction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now shall the service of treasure,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Kemble remarks on this passage, that it is not
improbable that the whole denunciation is a judicial
formula, such as we know early existed, and in regular
rhythmical measure.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>These early examples may be followed up by others
preserved to modern times. The most significant of
these occurs in the Church ceremony of marriage, which
preserves in the vernacular the ancient rhythmical
formula of the marriage laws, and the antiquity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
the Church ritual is proved from the fact that it is accompanied
and enforced by the old rhythmical verse,
which is indicative of early legal or ceremonious usage.</p>

<p>These words are inserted in our service according to
the ancient canon of England, and even when the Latin

which accompany the delivery of the symbolical pledge

fact, and as we trace out these rhythmical lines farther
back in their original vernacular, the more clearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
distinct is their archaic nature. According to the usage
of Salisbury the bride answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>To this may be added the many local examples of
the preservation of laws or legal formul&aelig; by means of

perhaps, is that by which the Kentishman redeemed his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>

<p>At Scarborough there is an old proverbial saying
as to "Scarborough Warning," which has had various
accounts given of its origin,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> but the true explanation
of which is that it is the fragment of an ancient legal
formula of the kind we are investigating. Abraham
De la Pryme describes it in his seventeenth-century
diary as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Scarburg Warning is a proverb in many places of the
north, signifying any sudden warning given upon any
account. Some think it arose from the sudden comeing
of an enemy against the castle there, and haveing dischargd
a broad side, then commands them to surrender.
Others think that the proverb had it's original from other
things, but all varys. However, this is the true origin
thereof.</p>

<p>"The town is a corporation town, and tho' it is very poor
now to what it was formerly, yet it has a ... who is
commonly some poor man, they haveing no rich ones amongst
them. About two days before Michilmass day the sayd
... being arrayed in his gown of state he mounts
upon horseback, and has his attendants with him, and the
macebear[er] carrying the mace before him, with two fidlers
and a base viol. Thus marching in state (as bigg as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
lord mare of London) all along the shore side, they make
many halts, and the cryer crys thus with a strange sort of a
singing voyce, high and low:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0bq">"'Whay! Whay! Whay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0bq">Pay your gavelage, ha!<br /></span>
<span class="i0bq">Between this and Michaelmas Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0bq">Or you'll be fined I, say!'<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Then the fiddlers begins to dance, and caper and plays,
fit to make one burst with laughter that sees and hears
them. Then they go on again and crys as before, with the
greatest majesty and gravity immaginable, none of this
comical crew being seen so much as to smile all the time,
when as spectators are almost bursten with laughing. This
is the true origin of the proverb, for this custome of gavelage
is a certain tribute that every house pays to the
... when he is pleased to call for it, and he gives
not above one day warning, and may call for it when he
pleases."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p></div>

<p>Rhyming tenures have been frequently noted but
never understood. They occur in many parts of the
country. The tithingman of Combe Keynes, in
Dorsetshire, is obliged to do suit at Winforth Court,
and after repeating the following incoherent lines,
pays threepence and goes away without saying another
word:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With my white rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am a fourth post<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That three pence makes three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God bless the King, and the lord of the franchise<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Our weights and our measures are lawful and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good morrow Mr. Steward I have no more to say to you."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to quote more examples.
They are not unknown to the historian, but because
they are in rhyme they have been hastily assumed to
be spurious or even burlesque.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> But the evidence of a
rhyming formula is the opposite to this. It is evidence
of their genuineness, and if some of the words appear
to be nonsensical it is due to the fact that the sense of
the old formula has been misunderstood, and has then
become gradually altered.</p>

<p>All these rhyming tenures, indeed, find their place
among the traditional examples of legal formul&aelig;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
They are the local offshoots preserved because of their
legal significance, preserved by those interested from
their legal side. Because they are not preserved in the
formal codes they need not be neglected, and they
must not be misunderstood. They are not to be put
on one side by the historian as freaks of local landowners.
They are real descendants by traditional
lines from the times when laws were not written, but
kept alive in the memory by means of such assistance
as rhyme could supply, and from the tribesmen who
thus treasured the law they obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>That this branch of recorded law is not only early
but tribal is undoubted, but perhaps it will be well to
refer to tribal rhyming formul&aelig; of an independent
kind in order to show by parallel evidence the tribal
characteristics. In 1884 Mr. Posnett drew attention to
this important subject, and noted that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dr. Brown, in an attempt to sketch the origin of poetry&mdash;an
attempt which attracted the attention of Bishop Percy in
his remarks introductory to the <i>Reliques</i>&mdash;proposed more
than one hundred years ago to discover the source of the
combined dance, song, melody, and mimetic action of
primitive compositions in the common festivals of clan life.
The student of comparative literature will probably regard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
Dr. Brown's theory as a curious anticipation of the historical
method in a study which, in spite of M. Taine's efforts, has
made so little progress as yet. The clan ethic of inherited
guilt and vicarious punishment has attracted considerable
attention. But the clan poetry of the ancient Arabs and of
the bard-clans, surviving in the Hebrew sons of Asaph or the
Greek Homerid&aelig;, has not received that light from comparative
inquiry which the closely connected problems of primitive
music and metre would alone amply deserve."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p></div>

<p>Not much has been done since this was penned. Max
M&uuml;ller had previously, in 1847, declared that the Rig
Veda consisted of the clan songs of the Hindu people,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
but the importance of such a conclusion has been
entirely neglected. In the meantime evidence is accumulating
that in Britain there are still preserved many
examples of clan songs. Thus Lord Archibald Campbell
has published, in the first volume of his <i>Waifs and
Strays of Celtic Tradition</i>, some sixteen or seventeen
sagas. Some of these are clan-traditions; and the
editor notes as evidence of their antiquity the fact
that none of them makes any mention of firearms.
These clan-traditions all relate to feuds and vendettas;
and in one case it is expressly recorded that the descendants
of one of the foes of the clan, in their account
of the incident narrated, "altered this tradition and
reversed the main facts." This has been followed by a
volume definitely devoted to "clan-traditions,"<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> while
in the <i>Carmina Gadelica</i> and many of the Highland
incantations there are preserved specimens of ancient
clan songs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
The most interesting of the tribal songs is that preserved
at the Hawick Common riding. The burgh
officers form the van of a pageant which insensibly
carries us back to ancient times, and in some verses
sung on the occasion there is a refrain which has been
known for ages as the slogan of Hawick. It is "Teribus
ye teri Odin," which is probably a corruption of
the Anglo-Saxon, "Tyr habbe us, ye Tyr ye Odin"&mdash;May
Tyr uphold us, both Tyr and Odin.</p>

<p>Fortunately Dr. Murray has investigated this formula,
and I will quote what he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A relic of North Anglian heathendom seems to be preserved
in a phrase which forms the local slogan of the town
of Hawick, and which, as the name of a peculiar local air, and
the refrain, or 'owerword' of associated ballads, has been
connected with the history of the town back to 'fable-shaded
eras.' Different words have been sung to the tune from
time to time, and none of those now extant can lay claim to
any antiquity; but associated with all, and yet identified with
none, the refrain '<i>Tyr-ibus ye Tyr ye Odin</i>,' Tyr h&aelig;b us, ye
Tyr ye Odin! Tyr keep us, both Tyr and Odin! (by which
name the tune also is known) appears to have come down,
scarcely mutilated, from the time when it was the burthen of
the song of the gle&oacute;-mann or scald, or the invocation of a
heathen Angle warrior, before the northern Hercules and the
blood-red lord of battles had yielded to the 'pale god' of the
Christians."</p></div>

</p>

<p>And in a note Dr. Murray adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ballad now connected with the air of 'Tyribus' commemorates
the laurels gained by the Hawick youth at and
after the disastrous battle, when, in the words of the writer,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0bq">"'Our sires roused by "Tyr ye Odin,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0bq">Marched and joined their king at Flodden.'<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
Annually since that event the 'Common-Riding' has been
held, on which occasion a flag or 'colour' captured from a
party of the English has been with great ceremony borne by
mounted riders round the bounds of the common land, granted
after Flodden to the burgh; part of the ceremony consisting
in a mock capture of the 'colour' and hot pursuit by a large
party of horsemen accoutred for the occasion. At the conclusion
'Tyribus' is sung, with all the honours, by the actors
in the ceremony, from the roof of the oldest house in the
burgh, the general population filling the street below, and
joining in the song with immense enthusiasm. The influence
of modern ideas is gradually doing away with much of the
parade and renown of the Common-Riding. But 'Tyr-ibus
ye Tyr ye Odin' retains all its local power to fire the lieges,
and the accredited method of arousing the burghers to any
political or civil struggle is still to send round the drums and
fifes, 'to play Tyribus' through the town, a summons analogous
to that of the Fiery Cross in olden times. Apart from
the words of the slogan, the air itself bears in its wild fire all
the tokens of a remote origin."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p></div>

<p>We could not get better evidence than this of the survival
of tribal custom, custom that is distinctly connected
with tribes rather than with places or individuals, with
groups of people who, now bound together by local
considerations and influences, have only recently passed
away from the far more ancient influences of the tribe.
Alike in the forms of historical codes and in traditional
local remains, we have found evidence of the use of
rhyme for the preservation of unwritten rules and
forms; and this use restores to tradition an important
branch of its material.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
We have thus ascertained that there is direct and acknowledged
indebtedness of history to tradition. Its
extent covers a wide area of culture progress, and of
unbroken continuity from tribal to historic times. The
legal codes of the barbaric tribes of Western Europe
are the direct successors of the traditional originals;
and because these legal codes, equally with their unwritten
predecessors, cannot be dispensed with by the
historian, they find their place unquestioned among
genuine historical material. They are no more, and
no less, historical than other traditional material. They
are part of the life of the people rescued from prehistoric
days, and they tell us of these days by the same sanction
and the same methods as the rest of the traditional
material which has been so strangely and so persistently
neglected by the historian. The whole of tradition, and
not selected parts of it, must be brought into use if we
would follow scientific method, and I claim this for the
study of folklore on the strength of the results which
have now been brought together.</p>

<p>Here, however, we are close up to an important
point of controversy. The mythologists claim tradition
as theirs. It does not, they assert, give us the
history but the mythology of our race. It tells us not
of the men but of the gods. In explaining how this
comes about, however, they have fallen into errors
which it is not only necessary to correct but which
are fundamental in their effects. We shall be better
able later on to discuss the extremely important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>question of the position of the prehistoric tradition
amidst historic life and surroundings, if we try to
understand what the mythologists have done and not
done in their attempts to claim exclusive property in
the folk-tale. They have entirely denied or ignored all
history contained in the folk-tale, and they have
proceeded upon the assumption, the bald assumption
not accompanied by any kind of proof, that the folk-tale
contains nothing but the remnants of a once
prevalent system of mythology. They ignore all the
proofs brought forward by folklorists to the contrary,
such proofs, for instance, as Mr. Knowles, Sir Richard
Temple and others have produced concerning the
Hindu folk-tale. What is not true of the Hindu folk-tale
cannot be true of its Celtic or Teutonic or Scandinavian
parallel, and yet in the most recent study of
Celtic tradition, Mr. Squire takes its mythic origin
for granted, and works through his ingenious statement
without let or hindrance from other points of
view. But even his thorough-going methods compel
him to stop short at certain points, and to admit that he
has come across historic fact. Thus he agrees that the
Fir-Bolgs "were not really gods but the pre-Aryan race
which the Gaels, when they landed in Ireland, found
already in occupation,"<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and yet when he treats
of the fight of the Fir-Bolgs with the Tuatha d&eacute;
Danann, and is confronted with Sir William Wilde's
proofs that the monuments on the plain of Moytura
are in agreement with the traditions concerning
them, and point to the account of the battle being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
historical,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> all that Mr. Squire can admit is that "certainly
the coincidences are curious." He disposes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
them on the ground that the "people of the goddess
Danu are too obviously mythical to make it worth while
to seek any standing ground for them in the world of
reality." That standing ground might be found connected
with the Tuatha d&eacute; Danann in many places, but
Mr. Squire will have it that it is impossible, because "it
was about this period that the mythology of Ireland
was being rewoven into spurious history."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> It is not,
however, upon the mistakes of other inquirers<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> that
the mythologists may rest a good claim for their own
view. The <i>Historia Britonum</i> of Geoffrey of Monmouth
disposes of neither the myths nor the history of
the Celts. It shows myth in its secondary position, in
the handling of those who would make it all history,
just as now there are scholars who would make it all
myth. In front of the legends attaching to persons
and places is the history of these persons and places.
Behind these legends lies the domain of the unattached
and primitive folk-tale, Mr. Campbell's <i>Highland Tales</i>,
Kennedy's <i>Fireside Stories of Ireland</i>, and those English
tales which have been rescued by Mr. Clodd and
others. This makes it impossible to see in the hero-legends
naught else than the intangible realm of Celtic
gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>Equally impossible is it to create for them a home in
a system of "state religion," and yet a state religion
is a necessary part of the evidence for mythological
origins.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> There was no Celtic state. Emphatically this
was so. Everything we know about the Celts of
Britain, both before and after the Roman conquest, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
in Britain, where the Roman power was upheld for four
centuries, and in Ireland, where the Roman power never
penetrated, the Celts were possessed of a tribal, not a
state polity; lived in tribal strongholds, not in Celtic
cities; occupied tribal territories, not countries formed
into states; elected tribal chiefs in primitive fashion,
and not kings with state ceremonial; and when they
come under the dominion of an incipient state policy
after the conquest of the English and the Northmen,
their laws are promulgated and codified, and show that
both Welsh and Irish codes are tribal, not state law.</p>

<p>Not only do I fail to discover a state religion of the
Celts, but I do not find it among the Teutons. There is
greater evidence of discrepancies than of agreement in
all the European religions, but these have not been
dwelt upon by scholars. Professor York Powell, in
one of his illuminating studies on Teutonic heathendom,
is the only authority I know of who argues
against the idea of a systematised religion. "It is
important that we should at once throw aside the
idea that there was any <i>system</i>, any organized pantheon
in the religion of these peoples. Their tribes
were small and isolated, and each had its own peculiar
gods and observances, although the mould of each
faith was somewhat similar. Hence there were varieties
of religious customs among the Goths, Swedes, Saxons,
and Angles."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Now if there was no state there could be no state
religion. What existed of worship and religion
was tribal. These are the historical facts, which
have been neglected by students of myth and saga.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>I shall have to point out in greater detail presently
what these tribal conditions mean to studies in folklore,
but the word of warning and protest must come here,
for it is unconsciously the conception of a Celtic state
religion which gives even the semblance of possibility
for Celtic mythology to be found in every hero-legend.
It is, in short, the neglect of this among other historical
facts which has led the folklorist into error of a somewhat
magnificent kind. He attempts to create out of
the myths of a people a mythology which provides
gods to be worshipped, faiths to be organised, and beliefs
to be the standards of life and conduct. Thus, as I
have pointed out elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Sir John Rhys has, in his
acute identification of the worship of the water-god
Lud on the Thames and of Nod on the Severn,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> introduced
the idea of a great Celtic worship established on
these two great rivers as parts of a definite system of
Celtic religion, whereas examination proves that the
parallel faiths of two perfectly distinct Celtic tribes, the
Silures on the Severn and the Trinovantes on the
Thames, were welded into a common worship of the
god of the waters by the masters of Celtic Britain, the
Romans. There was no Celtic organisation which
commanded both Severn and Thames until the Romans
occupied the country, and occupying the country they
adopted into their own religion the native gods and,
fortunately for us, recorded their adoption in the pavements
of their houses or their temples.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
Mr. A.&nbsp;B. Cook goes much further than Sir John
Rhys. He attempts to dig out the European sky-god
from all sorts of queer places, all sorts of forgotten
records, thereby producing a wealth of folklore parallels
for which every student must be profoundly thankful.
But he does not make it anywhere clear that this
universal god was gloriously apparent to his worshippers.
There is no established connection between
the sky-god and those who worshipped the sky-god,
and we seek in vain amidst all the brilliant researches,
which have been held to produce evidence of the sky-god,
for evidence that he was worshipped by the Aryan-speaking
Celt and Teuton. In point of fact, we never
get at the worshippers at all. There is the assumption
of a state mythology without any evidence for the
existence of the state.</p>

<p>In place of this obvious necessity we get an immense
abstraction, worked out with all the subtle ingenuity
and learning of the Cambridge professor. Mr. Cook
has, in fact, used the materials he has collected with
such amazing care to project therefrom just those
mythological conceptions which Celt and Teuton would
have worked out for themselves if they, like the Hindu
and the Greek, had developed the state while they
were still free to develop their own native beliefs.
This they never did, and so their fire worship did not
advance beyond its early stages. It was separated
from nature worship to become the servant of the
European tribes. It helped them to develop tribal and
family institutions. It produced for them a tribal and
family worship. It did not get beyond this, because
Roman institutions and Christianity stood in the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
and prevented tribal fire worship from becoming
anthropomorphised into a mythology. This need not
cause us to doubt that the analogies claimed by these
scholars are true analogies. There were among the
Celtic peoples, as among other branches of the race to
which Celt, Greek, Teuton, Scandinavian, and Hindu
belonged, the incipient elements which would go to
make up a national or state mythology, when the nation
or the state emerged, as it did emerge in the case of
Greece and of Rome, from its tribal originals. But the
Celtic state did not emerge from tribalism in Britain;
the Celtic heroes were always tribal heroes. They
were, as Hereward and Arthur were, real human flesh
and blood, fighting and raiding and loving and feasting
in their tribal fashion as the later heroes did in their
national fashion; because of their success as tribal
heroes they had attached to them the tribal myths;
because they died as nobly as Cuchulain died they
left imperishable records among those for whom they
died. They were more than gods to the Celtic tribesman&mdash;they
were kinsmen.</p>

<p>The false conception of a state religion before there
was a state, appears in other studies not primarily based
upon folklore research, and not having in view anthropological
results. It is the basis of the remarkable
researches of Sir Norman Lockyer as to the astrological
and solar origin of Stonehenge and other circles, and
in his chapter which deals with the question, "Where
did the British worship originate?" he finds himself
bound to the theory of a borrowed civilisation which
established the solar system.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> This borrowed civilisation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
is Egyptian, but it is too much to ask mythology
to supply not only a complete system of belief but
a civilisation which belongs to it. What is needed is
independent evidence of the civilisation. Without
such independent evidence it is impossible to accept
the deduction drawn only from one sphere of information.</p>

<p>The error of transferring to the domain of mythology
events and occurrences which belong to history, is
followed by an error of another sort, namely, the transferring
to some general department of human belief the
particular beliefs of a people, or of tribes of people. It
is wrong to continue to label particular cults as nature
myths, when they have already been transferred from
that position to a more definite position among the beliefs
of a people. Thus even so good a scholar as Mr.
A.&nbsp;B. Cook, rightly interpreting Greek evidence of the
hill-top fires and of the house fire, yet denies to the
exactly corresponding Irish evidence the same interpretation,
and argues that "the ritual of Samain, at which
all the hearths in Ireland were supplied with fresh fire
from a common centre at Tlachtga [is] almost certainly
solar," and that "we shall not be far wrong if we suppose
that the solar fires of Beltaine were the ritual of
the sky god connected with the Ash of Uisnech."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Mr.
Frazer, too, has interpreted these bonfires as mainly
sun charms, and he sees in the Balder myth, and in the
peasant customs all over Europe, which he asserts
illustrate this myth, an ancient ritual which originally
marked the beginning of the new year, when the tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
spirit, or spirit of vegetation, was burned, the special
reasons why the deity of vegetation should die by fire
being that as "light and heat are necessary to vegetable
growth, on the principle of sympathetic magic, by
subjecting the personal representative of vegetation to
their influence you secure a supply of these necessaries
for trees and crops."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Mr. Frazer goes far afield for evidence.
He does not see that the fire ceremonies which
he collects from all Europe have a specialised significance,
even in their last stages of existence as survivals,
which is not found among the Incas, the African tribes,
the hill tribes of India, and the Chinese, whom he cites
as providing the required parallels. Parallel practices
are not necessarily evidence of parallels in culture, and
it is the failure to locate properly the several examples
in relationship to each other which produces a loose and
inadequate conception of the relics of fire worship in
European countries, and the refusal to recognise its
special place as the cult of a tribal people.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Another
example of this fundamental error takes us in the very
opposite direction to that of Dr. Frazer. Thus Dr.
Gummere, in a recent study dealing with Germanic
origins,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> sees nothing in the fire cult of the Indo-European
people but a branch, and apparently an
undeveloped branch, of general nature worship, not
specially Germanic or Indo-European, not specialised
by the tribes and clans of these people into a cult far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
more closely connected with their doings and their life
than mere participation in the general primitive nature
worship could have afforded.</p>

<p>The danger of searching for a general system of
belief and worship from the beliefs and rites of peoples
not ethnically, geographically, or politically connected
is very great, and I venture to think that even Mr.
Frazer's remarkable researches into the agricultural
rites of European peoples do not take count of one
important consideration. I think his constructive hypothesis
is too complex in process and too systematic in
form to have been the actual living faith of the varied
paganism of the European peoples. It would have
meant as organised an institution as the Christian
Church itself, and of this there is no evidence whatever.
It would have meant an exclusive agricultural
ceremony, and of this there is strong evidence to the
contrary. It would have meant a deep system of
philosophy, penetrating from the highest to the lowest
of the people, and of this there is no evidence. The
plain fact is that the historical conditions have been
altogether left out of consideration in these matters,
and we consequently do not get a complete study. We
get the advocate's position. The case for the mythological
interpretation of folklore has been put with full
strength, but it is not the entire case.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>This short survey of the relationship of tradition to
history would not answer its purpose if we did not
consider the complementary position which history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
bears to tradition. This may best be done by reference
to the period before that occupied by contemporary
native record. The history here alluded to is, properly
speaking, only derived from one source, namely, the
works of foreign or outside authorities. It is written
by observers from a civilised country, travelling among
the more primitive peoples of another land, and the
Greek and Latin authors who relate particulars of
early Britain were of this class. Their narratives have
to be compared with the traditions written down as
history by professed historians, who lived long after the
events happened to which the traditions are said to
relate, but who recorded the traditions of the people
preserved in the monasteries by devotees who were of
the people, or by the songs and rhymes which, as
Henry of Huntingdon states explicitly, were used for
the purpose.</p>

<p>Both the observations of the foreign historians and
travellers and the recorded traditions from native
sources have been treated with scant courtesy whenever
they cannot be explained according to the views of
each particular inquirer into the period to which they
refer. They have been alternatively the subject of dispute
or neglect by students for a long series of years.
They consist of items which do not fit in with Celtic
or Teutonic institutions as we know them from other
and more detailed sources. They offend against the
national pride because they tell of a condition of
savagery. They do not appeal to the historian, because
the historian knows little and cares nothing at all about
the condition of savagery. If, therefore, they are not
rejected as true history, they are purposely neglected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
They are in any event never taken into consideration
by the right method, and they stand over for examination
by any one who will take the trouble to deal with
them by the light and test of modern research.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to deal with these matters now,
but it is advisable that we should try to understand two
things&mdash;first, how they have been dealt with by the
historian; secondly, their true place in history.</p>

<p>The Greek and Latin authors who have stated of
peoples living in Britain many characteristics which
do not belong to civilisation or even to the borders of
civilisation, range from Pytheas the Greek in the
middle of the fourth century before our era down to
the Latin poets of the early fifth century anno Domini.
They all refer to the British savage. He is cannibalistic,
incestuous, naked, possesses his wives in common,
lives on wild fruits and not cultivated cereals, indulges
in head-hunting, has no settled living-place which can
be called a house, and generally betrays the characteristics
of pure savagery.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Altogether there is a fairly
substantial range of material for the formation of a
reasonable conception of the condition of savagery in
Britain.</p>

We need not dwell long upon the earlier of our
historians who have neglected or contested the statements
of the authorities they use. They hardly possessed
the material for scientific treatment, and personal
predilections were the governing factors of any opinion
which is expressed. John Milton, in his brave attempt
to tell the story of early England, does not so much as
allude to these disagreeable points. Hume disdainfully
passes by the whole subject and practically begins
with the Norman conquest. Lappenberg says of the
group marriage of the Britons that it "is probably a
mere Roman fable."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Innes accepts the views of the
classical authorities and argues from them in his own
peculiar way,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> but Sullivan will have it that the
materials afforded from classical sources are worthless:
"they consist of mere hearsay reports without any
sure foundation, and in many cases not in harmony
with the results of modern linguistic and arch&aelig;ological
investigations."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Neither Turner nor Palgrave has
any doubt as to the authority of these early accounts,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
and Dr. Giles accepts the accounts which he so usefully
collected from the original authorities.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The modern historian cannot, however, be so incidentally
treated. He lives in the age of the comparative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
sciences and of anthropological research. He
sometimes uses, though in a half-hearted and incomplete
fashion, the results of inquirers in these fields of
research, but he nowhere deals with the problem fully.
His sins are not general, but special. He agrees with
one statement of his original authority and disagrees
with another, and we are left with a chaos of opinion
founded upon no accepted principle. If the earlier
historians accepted or rejected historical records without
much reason for either course, the later historians have
no right to follow them. The terms "savage" and
"barbarian," indulged in by the Greek and Roman
writers, cannot be rejected by modern authorities simply
because they are too harsh. They cannot be considered
merely in the nature of accusations against the standing
and position of our ancestors, made by advocates
anxious to blacken the national character. Even
scholars like Mr. Skene, Mr. Elton, and Sir John
Rhys, though inclined to weigh these passages by the
light of ethnographic research, throw something like
doubt upon the exact extent to which they may be
taken as evidence. Mr. Elton, though admitting that
the early "romances of travel" afford some evidence
as to the habits of our barbarian ancestors, cannot
quite get as far in his belief as to think that the account
of "the Irish tribes who thought it right to devour
their parents" is much more than a traveller's tale.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Sir John Rhys is not quite sure that the account by
C&aelig;sar of the communal marriages of the British is
"not a passage from some Greek book of imaginary
travels among imaginary barbarians which C&aelig;sar had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
in his mind,"<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> though he notes elsewhere that "the
vocabulary of the Celts will be searched in vain for
a word for son or daughter as distinguished from boy
or girl" as a fact of no little negative importance in
relation to C&aelig;sar's "ugly account;"<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and he has
similar doubts to express, noteworthy among them
being the passage from Pliny which illustrates the
Godiva story.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Mr. Skene lays stress upon the fact
that Tacitus "neither alludes to the practice of their
staining their bodies with woad nor to the supposed
community of women among them;" and he offers
some kind of excuse for the Roman evidence as to the
tattooing with representations of animals,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> evidence
which Sir John Rhys, too, is chary of accepting in its
full sense. Mr. Pearson reluctantly accepts C&aelig;sar's account
of the group marriage and the human sacrifice of
the Druids, but he ignores all else, including the attested
cannibalism of the Atticotti, though he mentions
that tribe in another connection.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Sir James Ramsay
agrees that the Britons tattooed their bodies with woad,
recognises the fact that their matrimonial customs were
polyandric, and that brother-and-sister marriage obtained,
and generally accepts the prevalent ideas as to
Celtic Druidism with its sacrificial rites and the system
of "state worship." He rests his views for much of
this upon the anthropological evidence in support of it.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
Mr. Lang on behalf of Scotland, and Dr. Joyce on
behalf of Ireland, have their say on the evidence.
Mr. Lang seems to accept C&aelig;sar's evidence "if
correctly reported," throws doubts upon the ethnological
value of such customs, and declares roundly
that to found theories upon such evidence as arch&aelig;ology
provides "is the province of another science, not
of history."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Dr. Joyce says that in early Greek
and Roman writers there is not much reliable information
about Ireland, though he believes them
when they talk of students from Britain residing in
Ireland and of books existing in Ireland in the fourth
century.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>This meagre result from the historians seems to me
to be most unfortunate. Even when the testimony of
early writers is accepted, it is accepted without the
necessary filling in which such an acceptance warrants.
Bare acceptance does not tell us much. Each recorded
fact has a relationship to surrounding facts, should
lead us to associated facts which, escaping observation
by early writers, can nevertheless be restored. In
history they are isolated and unconnected, because of
the faults of the historian who records them. Anthropologically
they belong to a wider grouping, reveal a
connection with each other which is otherwise unsuspected,
and prepare themselves for treatment on a
larger platform. The historian has used them for the
unprofitable controversy ranging round the question
of early Celtic civilisation, whereas they clearly belong
to the history of early man, and even the folklorist does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
not disdain to cast them on one side when they do not
suit his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>It is still more unfortunate that Sir Henry Maine
should have sought to enhance the value of his Indian
evidence by contrasting it with what he calls "the
slippery testimony concerning savages which is
gathered from travellers' tales,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and that Mr. Herbert
Spencer should have replied to this in an angry note,
declaring that he was aware "that in the eyes of most,
antiquity gives sacredness to testimony, and that so
what were travellers' tales when they were written in
Roman days have come in our days to be regarded as
of higher authority than like tales written by recent or
living travellers."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The scorn passed upon "travellers'
tales," the application of the term "romance" to the
early descriptions of voyages, have done the same
amount of mischief to these early chapters of history
as the constant disbelief in the value of tradition has
done to the testimony of folklore.</p>

<p>Now I do not recall these controversies, or lay stress
upon what appear to me to be the shortcomings of the
historian and folklorist in their relationship to each
other, for the purpose of reawakening old antagonisms.
I have merely selected a few illustrations of the present
position of the subject in order that it may be seen how
essential it is to proceed on other lines. All the items<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
which have formed the subject of dispute, together
with others which have escaped attention&mdash;items which
have found their way into history by accident, which
are by nature fragmentary and isolated, which do not
connect up with anything that is distinctively Celtic or
Teutonic, and which do not apparently fit in with any
standard common to themselves&mdash;must command attention
if only because they alone cannot be cut out of
history when items standing side by side with them are
allowed to remain, and in the end it can, I think, be
shown that they command attention because of their
inherent value.</p>

<p>The method of investigation as to the importance
and significance of these earliest historical records
must be anthropological. They are in point of fact so
much anthropological data relating to Britain. It is
no use calling them history, and then defining that
history as bad history simply because as history the
recorded facts do not appear to be credible. As a
matter of fact they belong to the prehistory period of
Britain, and to test their value scientific methods are
required.</p>

<p>In the first place, anthropology shows that there is no
<i><ins class="correction" title="'prima' in original">prim&acirc;</ins> facie</i>
necessity for calling them Celtic, thus
identifying them with that portion of our ancestry
which is Celtic in race; for there is evidence of a non-Celtic
race existing in prehistoric times, and existing
down to within historic times, if not to modern times.
Mr. Willis Bund has recently summarised the evidence
from arch&aelig;ology, philology, and tradition as it appears
in a particularly valuable local study of ancient
Cardiganshire, stating it "to be agreed that there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
more than one race of early inhabitants, and two of
the sources say that there was an original race and at
least two distinct races of invaders," and further, "that
whoever the original inhabitants were they were not
Celts."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> These original inhabitants, who were not Celts,
have left their remains in the barrows and megalithic
monuments which still exist in various parts of the
country, and anthropologists show that they have not
entirely disappeared from among the race distinctions
observable among the people of these islands. If it is
possible to proceed from this to another stage, and to
show from the British evidence what Mr. Risley has so
well illustrated from the Indian evidence, namely, that
gradations of race types as shown by anthropometrical
indices correspond with gradations of social precedence
and social organisation,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> it may yet be possible
to prove that the people who were not Celts
were the people with whom originated those recorded
customs and beliefs which are rejected as too savage
for the Celt. Unfortunately, we know nothing about
them, except the isolated scraps which are to be picked
up from the early historians. This compels us to turn
to other sources of information, and when we do this
we find that British folklore preserves in traditional
custom, rite, belief, and folk-tale, parallels to each
and every item of savagery mentioned by the early
historians of Britain; and further, that anthropology
shows clearly enough that among the customs and
beliefs of primitive races there are to be found parallels
to every item of custom and belief recorded of early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
Britain. This gets rid of one of our greatest difficulties,
and disposes of Dr. Sullivan's unwarranted
assertion to the contrary (<i>ante</i>, p. 113). The recorded
customs and beliefs of early Britain are proved by this
means not to be impossible or improbable factors in
the elements of the British prehistoric race. It will
not be possible to term them inventions of romance or
of false testimony, simply on the ground that they are
not found elsewhere. On the contrary it will, I think,
be difficult to resist the conclusion that inventions such
as these, covering a wide and ascertained area of
sociological and early religious development, could
hardly have been made by historians having the
limited range of knowledge possessed by the native
and classical writers who are responsible for the facts.
It is an easy, but not a satisfactory method of criticism
to declare what is not to one's liking to be invention
and romance, and it has until late years been difficult
to combat such an argument. The battle has raged
round wordy disputes, the merits of which are governed
by the abilities of the respective disputants; that
this is no longer possible is due to the fact that there
have entered into the fray the methods and results of
folklore which prevent the terms invention and romance
from being applied, except where there is good independent
reason for their use.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have now dealt with all the points which appear to
be necessary in order to show the inherent relationship
of folklore to history, and I have shown causes for
resisting the claims of mythology to appropriate what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
it chooses of folklore, and then to reject all the rest
from consideration. I have dealt (1) with examples of
local traditions and hero-traditions, in their relation to
history and historical conditions; (2) with the folk-tale
in its retention of details of early historic conditions, and
of the picture of early tribal organisation, and in that
its structure is based upon the events of savage social
conceptions; (3) with the early laws and rules of tribal
society preserved by tradition and accepted in historical
times; (4) with the claims of mythology to interpret the
meaning of folk-tales, and the reasons for rejecting
this claim; and (5) with the treatment by historians of
statements by classical writers as to the condition of the
peoples inhabiting Britain before the dawn of civilisation.
I think it will be admitted that, without pretending
in any way to have exhausted the evidence, or
even to have thoroughly comprehended and satisfactorily
stated it under each of these heads, a very
considerable claim has been made out for the historical
value of folklore. If so much has been gained
it will rest with folklorists to pursue investigations on
these lines, and it will remain with the historian to
consider the results wherever his research leads him
into domains where the evidence of folklore is obtainable.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the problems which the two
sciences, history and folklore, have to solve in conjunction
are not a few and that they are extremely complex.
They cannot be solved if history and folklore are separated;
they may be solved if the professors in each work
together, both recognising what there is of value in the
other. History in its earliest stages is either entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
dependent upon foreign authorities, or it has to follow
the practice of the earlier and unscientific historian and
to deny that there is any history, or at all events any
history worth recording, before the advent, perhaps
the accidental advent, of an historian on native ground.
History in its later stages is dependent upon the personal
tastes or ability of each historian for the record
of events and facts. Folklore in its earliest stages has
brought down from the most ancient times memories
of ancient polity, faith, custom, rite, and thought. In
its later stages it has preserved custom, rite, and belief
amid the attacks of the progressive civilisation which has
been developed, and it has clothed heroes of later times
with the well-worn trappings of those of old. Combined
history and folklore can restore much of the picture of
early times, and can work through the fulness of later
times with some degree of success. There is needed for
this work, however, a clear conception of the position
properly held by both sciences, together with established
rules of research. This is more particularly
needed in the department of folklore. I do not pretend
to be able to formulate these rules. In the subjects
dealt with in this chapter I have indicated a few of the
points which must be raised, and my object will be in
the remaining chapters to set forth some of the conditions
which it appears to me necessary to consider in
connection with the problems with which folklore is
concerned as one of the historical sciences.</p>

with reference to their geographical distribution, with a view of ascertaining
how far they follow the direction of the Roman, English, Danish
and Norman Conquests. See Henderson, <i>Folklore of Northern Counties</i>,
320, for Yorkshire examples, and <i>Folklore Record</i>, i. 16, for an interesting
Sussex example.</p>

<p>The Danish part of Lincoln, near Sleaford, has numerous treasure
legends, see Rev. G. Oliver, <i>Existing Remains of Ancient Britons between
Lincoln and Sleaford</i>, pp. 29 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Andrew has proved in the <i>British Numismatic Journal</i>
(1st ser. i. 9-59) that traditions of buried treasure may be verified a
thousand years after the laying down of the hoard. This has reference
to the famous Cuerdale find of coins. The people of Walton-le-Dale, on
the Ribble, had a legend that if you stood on a certain headland and
looked up the valley to Ribchester "you would gaze over the greatest
treasure that England had ever seen." The farmers tried excavations,
and the divining rod is said to have been used.</p>

<p>The tradition was true. In May, 1840, the hoard was accidentally
found, near Cuerdale Hall, within forty yards of the stream, by men
who were repairing the southern bank. A willow tree, still in its prime,
was planted to mark the spot. We do not know how much bullion was
scattered by the finders, but there was recovered a mass of ingots,
armlets, chains, rings, and so on, amounting to 1000 oz., with over
7000 silver coins. They lay in a crumbling leaden case, within a
decomposed chest of wood. There were about 1060 English silver
coins, whereof 919 were of the reign of King Alfred. There were
2020 from Northumbrian ecclesiastical mints, and 2534 of King Canute,
with 1047 foreign coins, mainly French. The treasure had belonged to the
Scandinavian invaders in the host of the Danish Kings of Northumbria,
and very many bore the mark of York, the Danish capital. The chest
was the treasure-chest of the Danes. The money had been seized in
England, 890-897; on French coasts, 897-910; and collected among the
Danes of Northumbria about 911. In that year, we know, the Danes
raided Mercia, and were followed by the English King and thoroughly
defeated. Their treasurer, Osberth, was killed, and it is argued that
the Danes fell back by the Roman road, and were trying to cross into
Northumbria by the ford at Cuerdale, but that, the ford being dangerous,
they were obliged to bury their treasure-chest forty yards on the southern
bank of the river. They were unable to cross, were cooped up in a bend
of the stream, and were all put to the sword. Mr. Lang discussed this
from the folklore point of view in the <i>Morning Post</i>, 2nd November, 1906,
and concludes that "granting that none who knew the site of the deposit
escaped, the theory marches well, and quite accounts for the presence of
the hoard where it was found. The Danish rearguard defending the line
of the Darwen would know that their treasure was hurried forward and
probably concealed, but would not know the exact spot."</p>

<p>Another good example is recorded in the <i>Antiquary</i>, xiv. 228. Further
Henderson notes that the Borderers of England and Scotland entrusted
their buried treasure to the brownie (<i>Folklore of Northern Counties</i>, 248).
This is exactly the same idea which exists throughout India. "Hidden
treasures are under the special guardianship of supernatural beings.
The Singhalese, however, divide the charge between demons and cobra
capellas. Various charms are resorted to by those who wish to gain
the treasures. A puj&acirc; is sufficient with the cobras, but the demons
require a sacrifice. Blood of a human being is the most important, but
the Kappowas have hitherto confined themselves to a sacrifice of a white
cock, combining its blood with their own, drawn by a slight puncture in
the hand or foot. A Tamil, however, has resorted to human sacrifice as
instanced by a case reported in the <i>Ceylon Times</i>."&mdash;<i>Indian Antiquary</i>,
1873. ii. p. 125.</p></div>

Shrewsbury. In the Abbey Church, forming part of a font, is the upper
stone of a cross (supposed to have been the Weeping Cross) which
was discovered at St. Giles's churchyard. It had been immemorially
fixed in the ditch bank, and all traces of its origin were quite lost, except
that an old lady, who was born in 1724, remembered having seen in
her youth, persons kneeling before this stone and praying. The transmission
of the tradition through very nearly three centuries proved
correct, for on its being loosened by the frosts of a severe winter, it
fell, and its religious distinction became immediately apparent from the
sculpture with which it was adorned.&mdash;<i>Eddowes' Shrewsbury Journal</i>, 5th

I cannot refrain from quoting the following, as it is from an out-of-the-way
source. At Seagry, in Wilts, is an ancient farm, one field of which
was known as "Peter's Orchard." The author of a local history
records the following: "It has been handed down from generation to
generation that in a field on this farm a church was built on the
site of an ancient heathen burial ground. In order to test the accuracy
of this tradition, in the autumn of 1882 I had excavations made on the
spot, which I will now describe. The field contains about ten acres,
and presents a very singular appearance. In removing the sods, about
two feet from the surface we discovered extensive stone foundations,
extending for a considerable distance over the field. From the charred
appearance of the stones they had evidently suffered from fire, thus
supporting the tradition of some of the oldest inhabitants that the
ancient church had been destroyed by fire. On continuing the search
we found, about two feet below these foundations, a quantity of early
British pottery, the remains of broken urns, some charred bones, and
heads of small spears. The following is an extract from a letter which
I have received from a gentleman, whose family have been connected with
this parish for over two hundred years, and who has given me great
assistance. He says: My father was born at Startley in 1784, and
remained there until about 1840. Both he and my grandfather were
deeply imbued with old folklore. I well remember them constantly
speaking of the firm belief handed down to them of the heathen burial
places at Seagry, and of the supposed ruins of a church and some
religious house at Seagry. I think the discoveries made (on the very
spot mentioned by tradition) in August, 1882, are abundant proof that
after the lapse of more than nine centuries actual verification of the
carefully transmitted tradition has at last been found."&mdash;<i>Bath Herald</i>,
1st September, 1883. If references to other examples were needed I
should like to note Sir William Wilde's illustration as to "how far the
legend, the fairy tale, the local tradition, or the popular superstition
may have been derived from absolute historic fact."&mdash;<i>Lough Corrib</i>,

story because&mdash;first, the Latin rhyme appearing in the Gaelic tale, the
twelfth-century Latin story and the German inscription "tell for the
origination of the story in one single place in historic times;" and,
secondly, because a Kashmir story (Knowles' <i>Folk-tales of Kashmir</i>, 241),
based on the same main incident, omits the minor incident of the mallet
altogether. The answer to the first objection is that the Latin rhyme has
been attached, in historic times, to the ancient folk-tale; and to the
second objection, that the Kashmir story preserves the main incident
of surrender of property upon reaching old age, and omits the more
savage incident of killing, because the Kashmir people are in a stage of
culture which still allowed of the surrender of property, but, like the
Scandinavians, did not allow of the killing of the aged. Similarly, an
English parallel to this form of the variant is preserved by De la Pryme
in his <i>Diary</i> (Surtees Society), 162. It must be remembered that the
Kashmiris occupy a land which is referred to by Herodotos (iii. 99-105)
as in the possession of people who killed their aged (<i>cf.</i> Latham,
<i>Ethnology of India</i>, 199); and if my reading of the evidence is correct,
this is also the case of the Highland peasant.</p></div>

<p>"From the most remote antiquity men joined together, and wishing
either to amuse themselves or to celebrate the praises of their gods sang
short poems to a fixed tune. Indeed, generally speaking, <i>the laws by
which they were governed</i>, the events which had made the greatest
impression on their minds, the praises which they bestowed upon their
gods or on their heroes were all sung long before they were written, and
I need not mention that according to Aristotle this is the reason why the
Greeks gave the same appellation to laws and to songs."</p></div>

manor of Umberleigh, near Barnstaple, and I have a note from Mr.
Edmund Wrigglesworth, of Hull, of a parallel to this being preserved
by tradition only. There is a tradition respecting the estate of Sutton
Park, near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, which states that it formerly
belonged to John of Gaunt, who gave it to an ancestor of the present
proprietor, one Roger Burgoyne, by the following grant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

was personal, upon localities. Nottingham is divided into two parts,
one having primogeniture and the other junior right as the rule of
descent. Southampton and Exeter have also local divisions. But
perhaps the most striking example is at Breslau, where there co-existed,
until 1st January, 1840, five different particular laws and observances
in regard to succession, the property of spouses, etc., the application of
which was limited to certain territorial jurisdictions; not unfrequently
the law varied from house to house, and it even happened that one house
was situated on the borders of different laws, to each of which, therefore,
it belonged in part; Savigny, <i>Private Int. Law</i>, cap. i. sect. iv.</p></div>

details of this great fight with great care, and it is impossible to ignore
his evidence as to the monuments of it being extant to this day among
the recorded antiquities of Ireland. The battle lasted four days. The
first day the Fir-Bolg had the best of the fighting, and pillar-stones
erected to the heroes who fell are still in situ. Clogh-Fadha-Cunga, or
long stone of Cong, which stood on the old road to the east of that
village and a portion of which, six feet long, is still in an adjoining wall,
being erected to Adleo of the Dananians, and Clogh-Fadha-Neal, or
long stone of the Neale, at the junction of the roads passing northwards
from Cross and Cong, commemorating the place where the king stood
during the battle. After the battle each Fir-Bolg carried with him a
stone and the head of a Danann to their king who erected a great cairn
to commemorate the event, and this must be the cairn of Ballymagibbon
which stands on the road passing from Cong to Cross. The well of
Mean Uisge is identified as that mentioned in the MS. accounts of the
battle, connected with a striking incident. After a careful examination
of the locality, says Sir William Wilde, with a transcript of the ancient
MS. in his hand, he was convinced of the identity of a stone heap
standing within a circle as the place where the body of the loyal Fir-Bolg
youth was burned. The second day's battle surged northwards,
and at the western shores of Lough Mask, Slainge Finn, the king's
son, pursuing the two sons of Cailchu and their followers, slew them
there, and "seventeen flag stones were stuck in the ground in commemoration
of their death," and by the margin of the lake in the island
of Inish-Eogan there stands this remarkable monument to this hour.
The line of the Fir-Bolg camp can still be traced with wonderful accuracy.
Caher-Speenan, the thorny fort, was a part of this camp, and still
exists. More to the south-east, on the hill of Tongegee, are the remains
of Caher-na-gree, the pleasant fort, and still further to the east are
Lisheen, or little earthen fort, and Caher-Ph&aelig;tre, pewter fort. Other
forts also exist to give evidence both of the Fir-Bolg and the Danann
lines. The Danann monuments are situate in the fields opposite the
glebes of Nymphsfield. Five remarkable stone circles still remain
within the compass of a square mile, and there are traces of others.
The Fir-Bolgs were defeated on the fourth day and their king Eochy
fell fighting to the last. "A lofty cairn was raised over his body,
and called Carn Eathach, from his name." On the grassy hill of
Killower, or Carn, overlooking Lough Mask, stands to this hour the
most remarkable cairn in the west of Ireland, and there is little doubt
this is the one referred to in the ancient tradition as commemorating the
death of the last Fir-Bolg king in Erin.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he materials of folklore consist of traditional
tales (so called) and traditional customs and
superstitions (so called), the feature of both
groups being that at the time of first being recorded
and reduced to writing they existed only by the force
of tradition. There is no fixed time for the record. It
is sometimes quite early, as, for instance, the examples
which come to us from historians; it is generally quite
late, namely, the great mass of examples which, during
the past century or so, have been collected directly
from the lips or observances of the people, sometimes
by the curious traveller or antiquary, lately by the professed
folklorist.</p>

<p>The consideration of the relationship of history and
folklore has cleared the ground for definitions and
method. Before the material of which folklore consists
can be considered by the light of method, we
must get rid of definitions which are often applied to
folklore in its attributed sense. Folk-tales are not
fiction or art, were not invented for amusement, are not
myth in the sense of being imaginative only.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Customs
and superstitions are not the result of ignorance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
and stupidity. These attributes are true only if folk-tales,
customs, and superstitions are compared with
the literary productions and with the science and the
culture of advanced civilisation; and this comparison is
exactly that which should never be undertaken, though
unfortunately it is that which is most generally adopted.
The folk-tale may be lent on occasion to the artist&mdash;to
Mr. Lang, to Mr. Jacobs, and their many copyists; and
these artists may rejoice at the wonderful results of the
unconscious art that resides in these products of tradition,
but the folk-tale must not be wholly surrendered.
It does not belong to them. It does not belong to art
at all, but to science. That it is artistic in form is an
addition to its characteristics, but has nothing whatever
to do with its fundamental features. Similarly
with legend. It may be lent to Malory, to Tennyson,
to Longfellow, to the literary bards of the romance
period, for the purpose of weaving together their story
of the wonderful; but it must not be surrendered to the
romancist, and, above all things, the romances must
never be allowed to enter the domain of folklore.
Romances may be stripped of their legends so that the
source of legendary material may be fully utilised, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
the romances themselves belong to literature, and must
remain within their own portals. And so with customs.
They may be pleasing and reveal some of the
beauties of the older joyousness of life which has passed
away, it is to be regretted, from modern civilisation;
they may be revived in May-day celebrations, in
pageants, in providing our schools with games which
tell of the romance of living. But they do not belong
to the lover of the beautiful or to the revivalists.
Equally with the folk-tale they belong to science. And
so also with superstitions. The Psychical Research
Society, the spiritualists, the professional successors of
the medi&aelig;val witch and wizard, may turn their attention
to traditional superstitions; but the folklorist refuses
to hand them over, and claims them for science.</p>

<p>This use of traditional material for modern purposes
is not the only danger to proper definitions. There is
also its appearance in the earlier stages of literature.
The traditional narrative, the myth, the folk-tale or the
legend, is not dependent upon the text in which it
appears for the first time. That text, as we have it, was
not written down by contemporary or nearly contemporary
authority. Before it had become a written document
it had lived long as oral tradition.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> In some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
cases the written document is itself centuries old, the
record of some early chronicler or some early writer
who did not make the record for tradition's sake.
In other cases the written document is quite modern,
the record of a professed lover of tradition. This
unequal method of recording tradition is the main source
of the difficulty in the way of those who cannot accept
tradition as a record of fact. In all cases the test of its
value and the interpretation of its testimony are matters
which need special study and examination before the
exact value of each tradition is capable of being determined.
The date when and the circumstances in
which a tradition is first reduced to literary form are important
factors in the evidence as to the credibility of
the particular form in which the tradition is preserved;
but they are not all the factors, nor do they of themselves
afford better evidence when they are comparatively ancient
than forms of much later date and of circumstances
far different. It cannot be too often impressed upon
the student of tradition that the tradition itself affords
the chief if not the only sure evidence of its age, its
origin, and its meaning; for the preservation of tradition
is due to such varied influences that the mere fact
of preservation, or the particular method or date of preservation,
cannot be relied upon to give the necessary
authority for the authenticity of the tradition. Tradition
can never assume the position of written history,
because it does not owe its origin, but only its preservation,
to writing.</p>

<p>Documentary material is examined as to its pal&aelig;ographical
features, as to the testimony afforded by its
author or assumed author, as to its credibility in dealing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
with contemporary events or persons, as to its date,
and in other ways according to the nature of the document.
Traditional material has nothing to do with all
this. It has no pal&aelig;ography; it has no author, and if a
personal author is assigned to any given fragment or
element it is generally safe to ignore the tradition as the
product of a later age; it does not deal with persons
nor, as a rule, with specific events; it has no date. It
has therefore to undergo a process of its own before it
can be accepted as historical evidence, and this process,
if somewhat tedious, is all the more necessary because
of the tender material of which tradition is composed.
This will be made clearer if we understand exactly what
the different classes of tradition are and how they stand
to each other.</p>

<p>Considering the materials of folklore in their true
sense and not their attributed sense then, we may proceed
to say something as to methods. Definitions and
rules are needed. No student can attack so immense a
subject without the aid of such necessary machinery,
and it is because the attempt has been so often made ill-equipped
in this respect, that the science of folklore has
suffered so much and has remained so long unrecognised.
Already, in dealing with the relationship of
history and folklore, one or two necessary distinctions
in terms have been anticipated. We have discovered
that the impersonal folk-tale is distinguished in a fundamental
manner from the personal or local legend, and
that the growth of mythology is a later process than
the growth of myth. These distinctions need, however,
to be systematised and brought into relationship with
other necessary distinctions. The myth and the folk-tale<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
are near relations, but they are not identical, and it
is clear that we need to know something more about
myth. Because mythic tradition has been found to
include many traditions, which of late years have been
claimed to belong to a definitely historical race of
people, it must not be identified with history. This
claim is based upon two facts, the presence of myth in
the shape of the folk-tale and the preservation of much
mythic tradition beyond the stage of thought to which it
properly belongs by becoming attached to an historical
event, or series of events, or to an historical personage,
and in this way carrying on its life into historic periods
and among historic peoples. The first position has
resulted in a wholesale appropriation of the folk-tale to
the cause of the mythologists; the second position has
hitherto resulted either in a disastrous appropriation of
the entire tradition to mythology, or in a still more disastrous
rejection both of the tradition and the historical
event round which it clusters. Historians doubting the
myth doubt too the history; mythologists doubting
the history reject the myth from all consideration, and
in this way much is lost to history which properly
belongs to it, and something is lost to myth.</p>

<p>If, therefore, I have hitherto laid undue stress
upon the foundation of tradition in the actual facts of
life, and upon the close association of tradition with
historic fact, it is because this side of the question has
been so generally neglected. Everything has been
turned on to the mythic side. Folk-tales have been
claimed as the exclusive property of the mythologists,
and those who have urged their foundation on the facts
of real life have scarcely been listened to. There is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
however, no ground for the converse process to be
advocated. If tradition is not entirely mythology it is
certainly not all founded on sociology, and the mythic
tradition in the possession of a people advanced in
culture has to be considered and accounted for. It is
myth in contact with history, and the contact compels
consideration of the result.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The first necessity is for definitions. Careful attention
to what has already been said will reveal the fact
that tradition contains three separate classes, and I
would suggest definition of these classes by a precise
application of terms already in use: The <i>myth</i> belongs
to the most primitive stages of human thought, and is
the recognisable explanation of some natural phenomenon,
some forgotten or unknown object of human
origin, or some event of lasting influence; the <i>folk-tale</i>
is a survival preserved amidst culture-surroundings
of a more advanced stage, and deals with events
and ideas of primitive times in terms of the experience
or of episodes in the lives of unnamed human beings;
the <i>legend</i> belongs to an historical personage, locality,
or event. These are new definitions, and are suggested
in order to give some sort of exactness to the terms
in use. All these terms&mdash;myth, folk-tale, and legend&mdash;are
now used indiscriminately with no particular definiteness.
The possession of three such distinct terms
forms an asset which should be put to its full use, and
this cannot be done until we agree upon a definite
meaning for each.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
The first place must be given to mythic tradition.
This is not special to our own, or to any one branch
of the human race. It belongs to all&mdash;to the Hindu,
the Greek, the Slav, the Teuton, the Celt, the Semite,
and the savage. It goes back to a period of human
history which has only tradition for its authority, in
respect of which no contemporary records exist, and
which relates to a time when the ancestors of now
scattered peoples lived together, and when they were
struggling from the position of obedient slaves to all
the fears which unknown nature inflicted on them, to
that of observers of the forces of nature.</p>

<p>Traditions which are properly classed as myth are
those which are too ancient to be identified with historical
personages, and too little realistic to be a
relation of historical episodes. They are rather the
explanations given by primitive philosophers of events
which were beyond their ken, and yet needed and
claimed explanation. In this class of tradition we are in
touch with the struggles of the earliest ancestors of man
to learn about the unknown. Our own research in the
realms of the unknown we dignify by the name and
glories of science. The research of our remote ancestors
was of like kind, though the domain of the unknown
was so different from our own. It was primitive science.</p>

<p>The best type of this class of myth is, I think, the
creation myth.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Everywhere, almost, man has for a
moment stood apart and asked himself the question,
Whence am I?&mdash;stood apart from the struggle for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
existence when that struggle was in its most severe
stages. The answer he has given himself was the
answer of the Darwin of his period. From the narrow
observation of the natural man and his surroundings,
governed by the enormous impressions of his own life,
the answer has obviously not been scientific in our sense
of the term. But it was scientific. It was the science of
primitive man, and if we have to reject it as science not
so good as our science, nay, as not science at all judged
by our standard, we must not deny to primitive man
the claim of having preceded modern man in his observation
and interpretation of the world of nature.</p>

<p>The range of the creation myth is almost world-wide.
It includes examples from all quarters, and examples of
great beauty as well as of singular, almost grotesque
hideousness; the New Zealand myth is surely the best
type of the former, and perhaps the Fijian of the latter.
As Mr. Lang says: "all the cosmogonic myths waver
between the theory of construction, or rather of reconstruction
and the theory of evolution very rudely conceived."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary to quote a large number of examples,
because I am not concerned with their variety
nor with their essentials. I am only anxious to point
out their existence as evidence of the scientific character
of primitive myth.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> It is not to the point to say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
the science was all wrong. What is to the point is to
say that the attempt was made to get at the origin of man
and his destiny. Mr. Lang thinks that "the origin of
the world and of man is naturally a problem which has
excited the curiosity of the least developed minds," but
in the use of the term "naturally," I think the stupendous
nature of the effort made by the least developed minds
is entirely neglected, and we miss the opportunity of
measuring what this effort might mean.</p>

<p>When savages ask themselves, as they certainly <i>do</i>
ask themselves, whence the sky, whence the winds, the
sun, moon, stars, sea, rivers, mountains and other
natural objects, they reply in terms of good logic applied
to deficient knowledge. All the knowledge they possess
is that based upon their own material senses. And therefore,
when they apply that knowledge to subjects outside
their own personality, they deal with them in terms of
their own personality. How did the sky get up there,
above their heads&mdash;the sky evidently so lovingly fond
of the earth, so intimately connected with the earth?</p>

<p>The New Zealand answer to these questions is a
great one, by whatever standard it is measured.
Heaven and earth, they say, were husband and wife, so
locked in close embrace that darkness everywhere prevailed.
Their children were ever thinking amongst
themselves what might be the difference between darkness
and light. At last, worn out by the continued
darkness, they consulted amongst themselves whether
they should slay their parents, Rangi and Papa, <i>i.e.</i>
heaven and earth, or whether they should rend them
apart. The fiercest of their children exclaimed, "Let us
slay them!" but the forest, another of the sons, said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
"Nay, not so. It is better to rend them apart, and to
let heaven stand far above us and the earth to lie under
our feet. Let the sky become as a stranger to us, but
the earth remain close to us as our nursing-mother."
The brothers consented to this proposal with the exception
of Tawhiri-ma-tea, the father of winds and storms;
thus five of the brothers consented and one would not
agree. Then each of the brothers tries to rend his
parents, heaven and earth, asunder. First the father
of cultivated food tries and fails; then the father of
fish and reptiles; then the father of uncultivated food;
then the father of fierce human beings. Then at last
slowly uprises Tane-mahuta, the father of forests, birds,
and insects, and he struggles with his parents; in vain
he strives to rend them apart with his hands and arms.
Lo, he pauses; his head is now firmly planted on his
mother, the earth; his feet he raises up and rests against
his father, the skies; he strains his back and limbs with
mighty effort, and at last are rent apart Rangi and
Papa, who shriek aloud with cries and groans. But
Tane-mahuta pauses not, he regards not their shrieks
and cries; far, far beneath him he presses down the
earth; far, far above him he thrusts up the sky. Then
were discovered a multitude of human beings whom
heaven and earth had begotten, and who had hitherto
lain concealed. But Tawhiri-ma-tea, the wind and
storm, the brother who had not consented, is angry at
this rending apart of his parents, and he rises and
follows his father, the sky, and fights fiercely with the
earth and his brothers.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
The explanation of this myth is simple. Unaided
by the facts of science, the New Zealand savages could
only think of the facts of their own experience. Only
two personalities could produce the various products of
the world; therefore the earth was the mother and the
sky the father. But they are now separated and apart.
Only a personality could have separated, and the forest,
root-sown in the earth, branch-up in the sky, is evidently
the means of this separation. And so, satisfactorily to
their own minds, these rude savages settled the question
of the origin of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>The close similarity of this to the story of Kronos
has frequently been pointed out; but a Greek story is
always worth repeating. Near the beginning of things
Earth gave birth to Heaven. Later, Heaven became the
husband of Earth, and they had many children. Some
of these became the gods of the various elements,
among whom were Okeanos, and Hyperion, the sun.
The youngest child was Kronos of crooked counsel,
who ever hated his mighty sire. Now the children of
Heaven and Earth were concealed in the hollows of
Earth, and both the Earth and her children resented this.
At last they conspired against their father, Heaven, and,
taking their mother into the counsels, she produced Iron
and bade her children avenge her wrongs. Fear fell
upon all of them except Kronos, and he determined to
separate his parents, and with his iron weapon he
effected his object. All the brothers rejoiced except one,
Okeanos, and he remained faithful to his father.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
It would be well for the sake of the story itself to
give a creation myth from India, but I shall have other
use for it than its particular charm.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'In the beginning, when Twashtri came to the creation
of woman, he found that he had exhausted his materials in
the making of man, and that no solid elements were left.
In this dilemma, after profound meditation, he did as follows.
He took the rotundity of the moon, and the curves of
creepers, and the clinging of tendrils, and the trembling of
grass, and the slenderness of the reed, and the bloom
of flowers, and the lightness of leaves, and the tapering
of the elephant's trunk, and the glances of deer, and the
clustering of rows of bees, and the joyous gaiety of sunbeams,
and the weeping of clouds, and the fickleness of the
winds, and the timidity of the hare, and the vanity of the
peacock, and the softness of the parrot's bosom, and the
hardness of adamant, and the sweetness of honey, and
the cruelty of the tiger, and the warm glow of fire, and the
coldness of snow, and the chattering of jays, and the cooing
of the <i>k&oacute;kila</i>, and the hypocrisy of the crane, and the fidelity
of the <i>chakraw&aacute;ka</i>, and compounding all these together, he
made woman and gave her to man. But after one week,
man came to him and said: Lord, this creature that you
have given me makes my life miserable. She chatters incessantly
and teases me beyond endurance, never leaving me
alone; and she requires incessant attention, and takes all
my time up, and cries about nothing, and is always idle;
and so I have come to give her back again, as I cannot live
with her. So Twashtri said: Very well; and he took her
back. Then after another week, man came again to him
and said: "Lord, I find that my life is very lonely, since I
gave you back that creature. I remember how she used to
dance and sing to me, and look at me out of the corner of
her eye, and play with me, and cling to me; and her laughter
was music, and she was beautiful to look at, and soft to
touch; so give her back to me again. So Twashtri said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
Very well; and gave her back again. Then after only
three days, man came back to him again and said: Lord, I
know not how it is; but after all I have come to the conclusion
that she is more of a trouble than a pleasure to me;
so please take her back again. But Twashtri said: Out on
you! Be off! I will have no more of this. You must
manage how you can. Then man said: But I cannot live
with her. And Twashtri replied: Neither could you live
without her. And he turned his back on man, and went on
with his work. Then man said: What is to be done? for I
cannot live either with her or without her.'"<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p></div>

<p>Now this myth has, so far as its central fact is concerned,
its counterpart in Celtic folklore. In the
Welsh Mabinogi of Math, son of Mathonwy, it is related
how Arianrod laid a destiny upon her son, whom
she would not recognise, that he should never have
a wife of the race that now inhabits the earth, and how
Gwydion declared that he should have a wife notwithstanding.
"They went thereupon unto Math, the son
of Mathonwy, and complained unto him most bitterly
of Arianrod. Well, said Math, we will seek, I and
thou, by charms and magic, to form a wife for him out
of flowers. So they took the blossoms of the oak, and
the blossoms of the broom, and the blossoms of the
meadow-sweet, and produced from them a maiden, the
fairest and most graceful that man ever saw." No one
can doubt that this interesting fragment of Welsh
tradition takes us back to a creation legend of the same
order as the Indian legend, and that the two widely
separated parallels belong to the period when men were
carving out for themselves theories as to the origin of
women in relation to men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
It is impossible to deny a place among these myths
of creation to the Hebrew tradition of Adam and Eve
in the Garden of Eden. The first chapter of Genesis
is the answer which the early Hebrews gave to the
scientific question as to the origin of man. How much
it cost them to arrive at this conclusion one cannot
guess, one only knows that it has become a glory to
the ages of Hebrew history, as well as to the civilisation
of Christianity. Unfortunately it has become much
more. The science of the primitive Hebrew has been
adopted as the God-given revelation to all mankind.
It is the function of folklore to correct this error, to
restore the Hebrew tradition to its proper place among
the myths of the world which have answered the cry of
early man for the knowledge of his origin. There is
no degradation here. Science is no longer in doubt
as to the origin of man within the evolutionary process
of the natural world, and it rightly rejects the first
chapter of Genesis as of value to modern research. But
science should accept it as a chapter in the history of
anthropology, a chapter which has only proved not to
be true, because of the limited range of early man in
the facts about man, but a chapter, nevertheless, which
has the inherent value of a faithful record of man's
search after truth. This is a great position. This is
the revelation which is made to us from the first
chapter of Genesis, and when the theologian is bold
and able enough to step outside the formularies of his
ancient faith, and reach the magnificent world of
thought which lies in front of him by the revelations of
scientific discovery, he will consider the anthropological
interpretation of the Hebrew Bible as one of the necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
elements of his equipment. There is on present
lines a whole world of thought between science and
religion, although they both have the same object.
They both seek the great unknown. Science, however,
gives up all efforts in the past which have proved futile
and erroneous, cheerfully surrenders all errors of
research and interpretation, starts investigation afresh,
begins new discoveries, and rewrites the story they
have to tell. Religion, on the other hand, comes to
a full stop when once she has made or accepted a discovery,
when once she has pronounced that the great
unknown has become known to her votaries and supporters.
She is skilful to use the results of science up
to the point where they serve her purpose, and to use
the terms of science in order to build up her shattering
position. But she does not advance. She does not
accept the first chapter of Genesis as a wonderful
revelation of the early stages of human investigation
into the realms of the unknown, but still keeps to her
old formula of a revelation of the deity as to the origin
of man, and she does not see that by this attitude she
is lessening every day her capacity for teaching truth.</p>

<p>I think the attitude of science to the Hebrew tradition
is only a little less unfortunate than that of religion.
Professor Huxley employed all the resources of his
great knowledge to disprove the scientific accuracy of
the tradition, and when one rereads his chapters on this
subject<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> one wonders at the absence of the sense of
proportion. Perhaps it was necessary, considering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
place which the Hebrew tradition occupies in civilised
thought, to show its utter inconsistency with the facts
of nature, but it was equally necessary to show that it
has its place in the history of human thought. The
folklorist replaces it among the myths of creation, and
then proceeds to analyse and value it. The Hebrew is
shown by the myth he adopted to have frankly acknowledged
that the origin of man and of the world was undiscoverable
by him. Whatever older myths he once
possessed, he discarded them in favour of a mythic
God-creator, and this is only another way of stating
that the mystery of man's origin could not, to the
Hebrew mind, be met by such a myth as the New
Zealander believed in, or as the Kumis believed in, but
could only be met by the larger conception of a special
creation. The Hebrew could not find his answer in
nature, so he appealed to super-nature. His God was
the unknown God, and the realm of the unknown God
was the unknowable. Though in terms this may not
be the interpretation of the Hebrew creation myth, its
ultimate resolve is this; and because modern science
has penetrated beyond this confession of the unknown
origin of man to the evolution of man, it should not
therefore treat contemptuously the effort of early
Hebrew science. Because it is not possible to admit
this effort as part of modern science, it must not be
rejected from the entire region of science. It must be
respected as one of the many efforts which have made
possible the last effort of all which proclaims that man
has kinship with all the animal world.</p>

<p>These points illustrate the unsatisfactory attitude of
science and religion to myth. There is still to notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
the unsatisfactory attitude of the folklorist. Wrong
interpretation of special classes of myth is, of course,
to be anticipated in the commencement of a great study
such as folklore; but there are also wrong interpretations
of the fundamental basis of myth. Thus even
Mr. Frazer, with all his vast research into savage
thought and action, doubts the possession of good
logical faculty by mankind. If mankind, he says, had
always been logical and wise, history would not be a
long chronicle of folly and crime.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> But surely we cannot
doubt man's logical powers. They have been too
strong for his facts. He has applied mercilessly all the
powers of his logical faculties upon isolated observations
of phenomena, and it is this limited application
which has produced the folly and crime. I venture to
think that civilised man shares with the savage of to-day,
and with the primitive ancestors of all mankind, the
charge of applying perfectly good logic to an insufficiency
of facts, and producing therefrom fresh chapters
of folly and crime.</p>

<p>If myth is correctly defined as primitive science, as
I have ventured to suggest, it is important to know
how it assumes a place among the traditions of a
people. Primitive science was also primitive belief.
If it accounted for the origin of mankind, of the sun,
moon, and stars, of the earth and the trees, it accounted
for them as creations of a higher power than man, or,
at all events, of a great and specially endowed man,
and higher powers than man were of the unknown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
realm. The unknown was the awful. Primitive science
and primitive belief were therefore on one and the
same plane.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> They were subjects to be treated with
reverence and with awe. The story into which the
myth was so frequently woven is not a story to those
who believe in the truth of the myth. It assumes the
personal shape, because the personal is the only
machinery by which primitive man is capable of expressing
himself. It was held only by tradition,
because tradition was the only means of transmitting
it, and it was of a sacred character, because sacred things
and beliefs were the only forces which influenced primitive
thought. When it was repeated to new generations
of learners, it was not a case of story-telling&mdash;it
was a matter of the profoundest importance. Everywhere
among the lowest savagery we find the secrets of
the group kept from all but the initiated, and these
secrets are the traditions which have become sacred,
traditions expressed sometimes in ceremonial, sometimes
in rites, sometimes in narratives. Thus the
mythological and religious knowledge of the Bushmen
is imparted in dances, and when a man is ignorant of
some myth, he will say, "I do not dance that dance,"
meaning that he does not belong to the group which
preserves that particular sacred chapter.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The Ashantees
have an interesting creation myth which is stated to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
the foundation of all their religious opinions.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Mr.
Howitt, in his important chapter on "Beliefs and Burial
Practices,"<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> seems to me to exactly interpret the savage
mind. The first thing he notes is the belief&mdash;a belief
that "the earth is flat, surmounted by the solid vault
of the sky," that "there is water all round the flat
earth," that the sun is a woman, and that the moon
was once a man who lived on earth, and so on. Then,
secondly, he notes the manner in which these beliefs
are translated to and held by the people, the myth in
point of fact&mdash;unfortunately, Mr. Howitt calls it a
legend&mdash;wherein it is perfectly obvious that the
Australian is interpreting the facts of nature in the
only language known to him to be applicable, namely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
that of his own personality. Messrs. Spencer and
Gillen produce much the same kind of evidence,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and
describe a ceremony among the northern tribes connected
with the myth of the sun, which ends in a
newly initiated youth being brought up, "shown the
decorations, and had everything explained to him."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
Among the central tribes the same authorities describe
minutely the initiation ceremonies, during which the
initiate boy "is instructed for the first time in any of
the sacred matters referring to totems, and it is by
means of the performances which are concerned with
certain animals, or rather, apparently with the animals,
but in reality with Alcheringa individuals who were
the direct transformations of such animals, that the
traditions dealing with this subject, which is of the
greatest importance in the eyes of the natives, are
firmly impressed upon the mind of the novice, to
whom everything which he sees and hears is new and
surrounded with an air of mystery."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Sir George
Grey, speaking of the traditions of the Maori which
he collected, says his reader will be in "the position of
one who listens to a heathen and savage high priest,
explaining to him in his own words and in his own
energetic manner, the traditions in which he earnestly
believes, and unfolding the religious opinions upon
which the faith and hopes of his race rest."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
"school of mythology and history," as it is significantly
termed in John White's <i>Ancient History of the
Maori</i>, was "Whare-Kura, the sacred school in which
the sons of high priests were taught our mythology and
history," and it "stood facing the east in the precincts
of the sacred place of Mua." The school was opened by
the priests in the autumn, and continued from sunset to
midnight every night for four or five months in succession.
The chief priest sat next to the door. It was
his duty to commence the proceedings by repeating a
portion of history; the other priests followed in succession,
according to rank. On the south side sat the
old and most accomplished priests, "whose duty it
was to insist on a critical and verbatim rehearsal of
all the ancient lore."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The American-Indian account,
by the Iroquois, of how myths were told to an ancient
chief and an assembly of the people on a circular open
space in a deep forest, wherein was a large wheel-shaped
stone, from beneath which came a voice which
told the tale of the former world, and how the first
people became what they are at present,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> is in exact
accord with this evidence. The priestly novice among
the Indians of British Guiana is taught the traditions
of the tribe, while the medicine man of the Boror&oacute;
in Brazil has to learn certain ritual songs and the
languages of birds, beasts, and trees.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>I do not want to press the point too far, because
evidence is not easy to get on account of the incomplete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
fashion in which it has been collected and presented to
the student. The records of native life are divided off
into chapters arranged, not on the basis of native ideas,
but on the basis of civilised ideas, and from this cause
we get myth and belief in different chapters as if they
had no connection with each other; we get myths treated
as if they were but the fancy-begotten amusements of
the individual, instead of the serious ideas of the collective
people about the elements of nature to which they
have directed their attention. Mr. J.&nbsp;A. Farrer comes
practically to this correct conclusion,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> while Mr. Jevons
seems to me to have arrived at the same result in spite
of some false intermediate steps, due to his failure to
discriminate between myth and mythology.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Failures
of this kind are of almost infinite loss to scientific
research. They stop the results which might flow from
the stages correctly reached, and hide the full significance
which arises from the fact that man's aspirations
are always so much in excess of his accomplished acts.
Poetry, philosophy, prayer, worship, are all short of the
ideal; and the question may surely arise whether the
actual accomplishments of man in civilisation, as compared
with those of man in savagery, afford any sort of
indication of the distance between man's accomplishment
and his aspiration at any age. If man has never
travelled at one moment of time, or at one definite
period of life, all this distance in thought, it may still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
be possible to use this distance between savage and
cultured accomplishment as a standard of measurement
between accomplishment and ideal, wherever the
material for such a purpose is available. If folklorists
will keep such a possibility in mind, whenever
they are called upon to investigate myth, it will at
all events save them from proceeding upon lines which
cannot lead to progress in the investigation of human
history.</p>

<p>The primitive myth does not include all that properly
comes within the definition of myth. There must be
included the myth formed to explain a rite or ceremony,
which originating in most ancient times has been
kept up at the instance of a particular religion or cult,
but the meaning and intent of which has been forgotten
amidst the progress of a later civilisation.
Pausanias is the great storehouse of such myths as
this, and Mr. Lang has, more than any other scholar,
examined and explained the process which has
gone on.</p>

<p>There is also included in this secondary class of
myth, the myths upon which are founded the great
systems of mythology. The Hindu mythology, in spite
of all that has been done to place it on the pedestal of
primitive original thought, is definitely relegated to the
secondary position by its best exponents. The Vedic
religion is tribal in form, and in the pre-mythological
stage.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan&aacute; and Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, on the
contrary, "we trace unequivocal indications of a departure
from the elemental worship of the Vedas, and
the origin or elaboration of legends which form the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
great body of the mythological religion of the Hindus."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
The pre-mythological and the mythological stages of
Hindu religion, therefore, are both discoverable from
the traditional literature which has descended from
both ages, and this fact is important in the classification
of the various phases of tradition. When once
it is admitted that the beginnings of mythology are to
be traced in one section of the people who are supposed
to derive a common system of mythology from a common
home, future research will hesitate to interpret,
as Kuhn and Max M&uuml;ller and their school have done,
the traditions of Celts, Teutons, and Scandinavians as
the detritus of ancient mythologies instead of the
beginnings of what, under favourable conditions, might
have grown into mythologies. Mythological tradition
is essentially a secondary not a primary stage. This
fact is overlooked by many authorities, and I have
noted some of the unfortunate results. It is not overlooked
by those who study the principles of their subject
as well as the details. Thus, as Robertson-Smith has
so well explained, "mythology was no essential part
of ancient religion, for it had no sacred sanction and
no binding force on the worshippers.... Belief in
a certain series of myths was neither obligatory as
a part of true religion, nor was it supposed that by
believing a man acquired religious merit and conciliated
the favour of the gods. What was obligatory
or meritorious was the exact performance of certain
sacred acts prescribed by religious tradition. This
being so, it follows that mythology ought not to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
the prominent place that is too often assigned to it
in the scientific study of ancient faiths."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> This is
exactly the position, and all that I have advanced for
the purpose of aiming at a classification of the various
kinds of tradition is in accord with this view.</p>

<p>All that I am anxious to prove, all that it is possible to
prove, from these considerations of the position occupied
by myth, is that myths constitute a part of the serious life
of the people. They belong to the men and women, perhaps
some of them to the men only and others to the
women only, but essentially to the life of the people.</p>

<p>I do not think that even Mr. Hartland in his special
study of the subject has quite understood this. He
begins at a later period in the history of tradition, the
period of story-telling proper, when myths have become
folk-tales,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and he treats this period as the earliest
instead of the secondary stage of myth. In this stage
something has happened to push myth back from the
centre of the people's life to a lesser position&mdash;a new
religious influence, a new civilisation, a new home, any
one of the many influences, or any combination of influences,
which have affected peoples and sent them
along the paths of evolution and progress.</p>

<p>It is in this way that we come upon the folk-tale.
The folk-tale is secondary to the myth. It is the primitive
myth dislodged from its primitive place. It has
become a part of the life of the people, independently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
of its primary form and object and in a different sense.
The mythic or historic fact has been obscured, or has
been displaced from the life of the people. But the
myth lives on through the affections of the people for the
traditions of their older life. They love to tell the story
which their ancestors revered as myth even though it has
lost its oldest and most impressive significance. The
artistic setting of it, born of the years through which it
has lived, fashioned by the minds which have handed
it down and embellished it through the generations,
has helped its life. It has become the fairy tale or the
nursery tale. It is told to grown-up people, not as
belief but as what was once believed; it is told to
children, not to men; to lovers of romance, not to worshippers
of the unknown; it is told by mothers and
nurses, not by philosophers or priestesses; in the
gathering ground of home life, or in the nursery, not
in the hushed sanctity of a great wonder.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
The influence of changing conditions upon the
position of mythic tradition is well illustrated by
Dr. Rivers in his account of the Todas. This people,
he says, "are rapidly forgetting their folk-tales and the
legends of their gods [that is, their myths], while their
ceremonial remains to a large extent intact and seems
likely to continue so for some time." Dr. Rivers attributes
this to the effect of intercourse with other
people. This intercourse has had no missionary results
and has not therefore affected their religious rites and
ceremonies, but has shown itself largely in the form of
loss of interest in the stories of the past.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In other
words, and in accordance with the definitions I am
suggesting, the primitive myths of the Todas have
definitely assumed a secondary position as folk-tale, and
not a strong position at that, while religion has clung
to rite and formula.</p>

<p>Primitive myth dislodged in this fashion is sometimes
preserved in a special manner and for religious
purposes in its ancient setting as a belief, or as a
tradition belonging to sacred places and appertaining
to sacred things. This is what has happened to the
Genesis myth of the Hebrews; it has also happened to
some of the sacred myths of the Hindus, and perhaps
to some of the sacred myths of the Greeks. In this
position the myth may even be reduced to writing, and
where this happens all the sacredness appertaining to
tradition is transferred to the written instrument.</p>

<p>Thus in Arkadia, Pausanias tells us, was a temple of
Demeter, and every second year, when they were celebrating
what they called the greater mysteries, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
took out certain writings which bore on the mysteries,
and having read them in the hearing of the initiated,
put them back in their place that same night.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In India
examples occur of land being held for telling stories
at the Uch&aacute;os or festivals of the goddess D&eacute;vi.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The
colleges of Rome, composed of men specially skilled
in religious lore, and charged with the preservation of
traditional rules regarding the more general religious
observances, the proper fulfilment of which implied a
certain amount of information, and rendered it necessary
for the state in its own interest to provide the
faithful transmission of that information, have been
described by Mommsen.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>I pass to the third class of tradition, namely, the
legend, and this need not detain us long. We have
already illustrated it by the notes on history and folklore,
and by its very nature it belongs essentially to
the historic age. In dealing with legend, there is first
to determine whether its characters are historical, or
are unknown to history. If the former, there is next
to disengage those parts of the tradition which, by their
parallels to other traditions, or by their nature, may
be safely certified as not belonging to the historical
hero or to the period of the historical hero. If the
latter, the details must be analysed to see what elements
of culture are contained therein. In both cases tradition
will have served a purpose, and that purpose
must be sought. Tradition does not attach itself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
an historical personage without cause. There is
necessity for it, and in the case of Hereward the
necessity was proved to have been the great gap in
the history of a national hero. Tradition does not preserve
details of primitive culture-history without cause,
and in the examples already quoted it has been shown
that this cause rests upon the indissoluble links which
the uncultured peasant of to-day has with the pre-cultured
past of his race. He will have forgotten all
about his tribal life and its consequences, but will
retain legends which are founded upon tribal life. He
will have lost touch with ideas which proclaim that man
or woman not of his tribe is an enemy to be feared or
attacked, but will gladly relate legends which deal
with events growing out of a state of perpetual strife
among the ancestors of people now in friendship. He
will not understand the personal tie of ancient times,
but will listen to the legends attached to places in such
strange fashion as to make places seem to possess a
personal life full of events and happenings. He will
know nothing of giants and ogres, but will love the
legends which tell of heroes meeting and conquering
such beings. The history of the school books is
nothing to him, but the history unknowingly contained
in the legends is very real, and is applied over and over
again to such later events as by force of circumstances
become stamped upon the popular mind and thus
succeed in displacing the original. It would be an
important contribution to history to have these legends
collected and examined by a competent authority. They
would be beacon lights of national history preserved in
legend.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
It will be readily conceded, I think, that in attempting
these definitions of the various classes of tradition, and
in illustrating them from the records of man's life in
various parts of the world, it has been impossible for
me to deal with certain points in the problem before
us. In particular I have not considered the favourite
subject of the diffusion of folk-tales. I do not believe
in a general system of diffusion, such a system, I mean,
as would suffice to account for the parallels to be found
in almost all countries.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> I think diffusion occupies a
very small part indeed of the problem, and that it only
takes place in late historical times. It is a large subject,
and I have virtually stated my answer to the theory of
diffusion in the definitions and classifications which I
have ventured to put forward. It may be considered by
some that other facts in the conditions of myth, folk-tale,
and legend would not confirm the general outline I
have given of the three classes of tradition to which
I have applied these terms; and of course there are
many side issues in so great a problem. I would not
urge the correctness of the views I have put forward
as applicable to every part of the world, or to every
phase in the history of tradition; but I would urge
that in the great centres of traditional life they are
practically the only means of arriving at the position
occupied by tradition, and that in all cases they form
a working hypothesis upon which future inquirers may
well base their researches.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span></p>
<h4>II</h4>

<p>Of late years there have been placed alongside of
the traditional myth, folk-tale, and legend many other
products of tradition&mdash;customs, ceremonies, practices,
and beliefs, and it has been argued, and argued
strongly and convincingly, that the tradition which
has brought down the saga and song as far-off echoes
of an otherwise unrecorded past has also brought down
these other elements which must also belong to the
same distant past. This argument is now no longer
seriously disputed. But there still remains open for
discussion the exact kind of evidence which these
elements of tradition supply, the particular period or
people from which they have descended, the particular
department of history to which they relate. All this is
highly disputed.</p>

<p>Folklore has in this department been greatly aided
by Dr. Tylor's impressive terminology, whereby the
custom, ceremony, practice, and belief which have come
down by tradition are classed as "survivals." This
term implies an ancient origin, and the necessary
work of the student is to get back to the original.
Until very lately the fact of survival has carried with it
the presumption of ancient origin, but Mr. Crawley
has raised an objection which I think it is well to meet.
He urges that "the history of religious phenomena
exemplifies in the most striking manner the continuity
of modern and primitive culture; but there is a tendency
on the part of students to underestimate this
continuity, and, by explaining it away on a theory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
survivals, to lose the only opportunity we have of deducing
the permanent elements of human nature."</p>

<p>This sentence at once prepares us for much that
follows; but Mr. Crawley leaves the point itself untouched,
except by implication, until he is in the
middle of his book, and then we have his dictum that
"it may be finally asserted that nothing which has to
do with human needs ever survives as a mere survival."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
It will at once be seen that we have here a new estimate
of the force which survivals play in the evidence of
human progress. They prove the continuity of modern
and primitive culture. They are part and parcel of
modern life, filling a vacuum which has not been filled
by modern thought, carrying on, therefore, the standard
of religious belief and religious ideal from point to
point until they can be replaced by newer ideas and
concepts. This definition of survivals is very bold.
It answers Mr. Crawley's purpose and argument in a
way which no other fact in human history, so far as we
can judge, could answer it. It is the basis upon which
his whole argument is founded. Occupying such an
important place, it should have received explicit investigation,
instead of being treated as a sort of side
issue of incidental importance.</p>

<p>When explicit investigation is undertaken, Mr.
Crawley's case must, I think, break down. Survivals
are carried along the stream of time by people whose
culture-status is on a level with the culture in which
the survivals originated. It matters not that these
people are placed in the midst of a higher civilisation
or alongside of a higher civilisation. When once the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
higher civilisation penetrates to them, the survival is
lost. There is not continuity between modern and
primitive thought here, but, on the contrary, there is
strong antagonism, ending with the defeat and death
of the primitive survival. This is the evidence wherever
survivals can be studied, whether in the midst of
our own civilisation, or even of primitive civilisations,
which constantly exhibit traces of older beliefs and
ideas being pushed out of existence by newer. It is,
indeed, a mistake to suppose, as some authorities
apparently do, that survivals can only be studied when
they are embedded in a high civilisation. It is almost
a more fruitful method to study them when they appear
in the lower strata; and even in such a case as the
Australian aborigines I think that it is the neglect
of observing survivals that has led to some of the
erroneous theories which have recently been advanced
against Messrs. Spencer and Gillen's conclusions.</p>

<p>For the purpose of examining survivals in custom,
rite, and belief, we have nothing more than a series of
notes of customs and beliefs obtaining among the
lower and lowest classes of the people, and not being
the direct teaching of any religious or academic body.
These notes are very unequal in value, owing to the
manner in which they have been made. They are often
accidental, they are seldom if ever the result of trained
observation, and they are often mixed up with theories
as to their origin and relationship to modern society
and modern religious beliefs. To a great extent the
two first of these apparent defects are real safeguards,
for they certify to the genuineness of the record, a certificate
which is more needed in this branch of inquiry than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
perhaps in any other. But with regard to the third
defect there is considerable danger. An inquirer with
an object is so apt to find what he wishes to find, either
by the exercise of his own credulity or the ingenuous
extension of inquiry into answer; whereas the inquirer
who is content to note with the simplicity of those who
occupy themselves by collecting what others have not
collected, may be deficient in the details he gives, but
is seldom wrong or violently wrong in what he has
recorded. In every direction, however, great caution
is needed, and especially where any section of custom
and belief has already been the subject of inquiry.
It is indeed almost safe to say that all research into
custom and belief, even that of such masters as Tylor,
Lang, Hartland, Frazer, and others, needs re-examination
before we can finally and unreservedly accept the
conclusions which have been arrived at.</p>

<p>Such an examination must be directed towards
obtaining some necessary points in the life-history of
each custom, rite, and belief. We have to approach
this part of our work guided by the fact that folklore
cannot by any possibility develop. The doctrine of
evolution is so strong upon us that we are apt to apply
its leading idea insensibly to almost every branch of
human history. But folklore being what it is, namely
the survival of traditional ideas or practices among a
people whose principal members have passed beyond
the stage of civilisation which those ideas and practices
once represented, it is impossible for it to have
any development. When the original ideas and practices
which it represents were current as the standard
form of culture, their future history was then to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
looked for along the lines of development. But so soon
as they dropped back behind the standard of culture,
whatever the cause and whenever the event happened,
then their future history could only be traced along the
lines of decay and disintegration. We are acquainted
with some of the laws which mark the development of
primitive culture, but we have paid no attention to the
influences which mark the existence of survivals in
culture. For this purpose we must first ascertain what
are the component parts of each custom or superstition;
secondly, we must classify the various elements in
each example; and thirdly, we must group the various
examples into classes which associate with each other
in motif and character.</p>

<p>By this treble process we shall have before us examples
of the changes in folklore, and demonstrably
they are changes of decay, not of development. By
grouping and arranging these changes it may be
possible to ascertain and set down the laws of change&mdash;for
that there are laws I am nearly certain. It is
these laws which must be discovered before we can
go very far forward in our studies. Every item of
custom and superstition must be tested by analysis to
find out under which power it lives on in survival, and
according to the result in each case, so may we hope
to find out something about the original from which
the survival has descended.</p>

<p>Each folklore item, in point of fact, has a life history
of its own, and a place in relationship to other
items. Just as the biography of each separate word
in our language has been investigated in order to
get at Aryan speech as the interpretation of Aryan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
thought, so must the biography of each custom, superstition,
or story be investigated in order to get at Aryan
belief or something older than Aryan belief. We must
try to ascertain whether each item represents primitive
belief by direct descent, by symbolisation, or by
changes which may be discovered by some law
equivalent to Grimm's law in the study of language.</p>

<p>Analysis of each custom, rite, or belief will show it
to consist of three distinct parts, which I would distinguish
by the following names:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The formula.</p>

<p>2. The purpose.</p>

<p>3. The penalty or result.</p>

<p>It will be found that these three component parts
are not equally tenacious of their original form in
all examples. In one example we may find the
formula either actually or symbolically perfect, while
the purpose and penalty may not be easily distinguishable.
Or it may happen that the formula remains
fairly perfect; the purpose may be set down to the
desire of doing what has always been done, and the
penalty may be given as luck or ill-luck. Of course,
further variations are possible, but these are usually the
more general forms.</p>

<p>I will give an example or two of these phases of
change or degradation in folklore. First, then, where
the formula is complete, or nearly so, and the purpose
and penalty have both disappeared. At Carrickfergus
it was formerly the custom for mothers, when giving
their child the breast for the last time, to put an egg in
its hand and sit on the threshold of the outer door with
a leg on each side, and this ceremony was usually done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
on a Sunday. Undoubtedly I think we have here a
very nearly perfect formula; but what is its purpose,
and what is the penalty for non-observance? Upon
both these latter points the example is silent, and
before they can be restored we must search among the
other fragments of threshold customs and see whether
they exist either separately from the formula or with a
less perfect example. Secondly, where the formula
has disappeared and the purpose and penalty remain,
nearly the whole range of those floating beliefs and
superstitions which occupy so largely the collections
of folklore would supply examples. But I will select
one example which will be to the point. When the
Manx cottager looks for the traces of a foot in the
ashes of his firegrate for the purpose of seeing in what
direction the toes point, the penalty being that, if they
point to the door, a death will occur, if to the fireplace,
a birth,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> there is no trace of the ancient formula. It is
true we may find the missing formula in other lands;
for instance, among some of the Indian tribes of
Bombay. There the formula is elaborate and complete,
while the purpose and the penalty are exactly the same
as in the Isle of Man. But this hasty travelling to
other lands is not, I contend, legitimate in the first
place. We must begin by seeing whether there is not
some other item of folklore, perhaps now not even connected
with the house-fire group of customs and superstitions,
whose true place is that of the lost formula of
this interesting Manx custom. And when once we
have taught ourselves the way to restore these lost
formul&aelig; to their rightful places, the explanation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
mere waifs and strays of folklore will be attended with
some approach to scientific accuracy, and we shall then
be in a position to get rid of that shibboleth so dear to
the non-folklore critic, that all these things we deal
with are "mere superstitions."</p>

<p>Thirdly, when the formula is complete, or nearly so,
and the purpose and penalty become generalised. At
St. Edmundsbury a white bull, which enjoyed full ease
and plenty in the fields, and was never yoked to the
plough or employed in any service, was led in procession
in the chief streets of the town to the principal
gate of the monastery, attended by all the monks singing
and a shouting crowd. Knowing what Grimm has
collected concerning the worship of the white bull,
knowing what is performed in India to this day, there
is no doubt that this formula of the white bull at
St. Edmundsbury has been preserved in very good
condition. The purpose of it was, however, not so
satisfactory. It is said to have taken place whenever a
married woman wished to have a child; and the penalty
is lost in the obvious generalisation that not to perform
the ceremony is not to obtain the desired end.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The second process, that of classification of the
various elements in each example, will reveal some
characteristics of folklore, which, so far as I know,
have never yet been taken count of. One very important
characteristic is the prevalence of a particular
belief attached to different objects in different places.
Thus Sir John Rhys in his examination of Manx<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
folklore stopped short in his explanation of the
superstition of the first-foot, because he had heard
that, while in the Isle of Man it was attached to
a dark man, elsewhere it was attached to a fair
man. Of the examples where, on New Year's morning,
it is held to be unlucky to meet a dark person,
I may mention Lincolnshire, Durham, Yorkshire, and
Northumberland. It is, on the contrary, <i>lucky</i> to meet,
as first-foot, a dark-haired man in Lancashire, the Isle
of Man, and Aberdeenshire.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In these cases we get the
element of "dark" or "fair" as the varying factor of
the superstition; but instances occur in Sutherlandshire,
the West of Scotland, and in Durham, where the varying
factor rests upon sex&mdash;a man being lucky and a
woman being unlucky.</p>

<p>Similarly of the well-known superstition about telling
the bees of the death of their owner, in Berkshire,
Bucks, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumberland, Lincolnshire,
Lancashire, Monmouthshire, Notts, Northumberland,
Shropshire, Somersetshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Sussex,
Wilts, Worcestershire, it appears that a relative may perform
the ceremony, or sometimes a servant merely, while
in Derbyshire, Hants, Northants, Rutland, and Yorkshire
it must be the heir or successor of the deceased
owner. Again, while in the above places the death of
the owner is told to the bees, in other places it is told to
the cattle, and in Cornwall to the trees;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and, in other
places, marriages as well as death are told to the bees.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>In some cases the transfer from one object to another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
of a particular superstition is a matter of absolute
observation. Thus, the labourers in Norfolk considered
it a presage of death to miss a "bout" in corn
or seed sowing. The superstition is now transferred to
the drill, which has only been invented for a century.
Again, in Ireland, it is now considered unlucky to
give any one a light for his pipe on May-day&mdash;a very
modern superstition, apparently. But the pipe in this
case has been the means of preserving the old superstition
found in many places of not giving a light from
the homestead fire.</p>

<p>I will just refer to one other example, the well-known
custom of offering rags at sacred wells. Sir
John Rhys thought that the object of these scraps
of clothing being placed at the well was for transferring
the disease from the sick person to some one
else. But I ventured to oppose this idea, and considered
that they were offerings, pure and simple, to
the spirit of the well, and referred to examples in
confirmation. Among other items, I have come across
an account of an Irish "station," as it is called,
at a sacred well, the details of which fully bear
out my view as to the nature of the rags deposited
at the shrine being offerings to the local deity. One
of the devotees, in true Irish fashion, made his offering
accompanied by the following words: "To St. Columbkill&mdash;I
offer up this button, a bit o' the waistband o'
my own breeches, an' a taste o' my wife's petticoat, in
remimbrance of us havin' made this holy station; an'
may they rise up in glory to prove it for us in the last
day."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> I shall not attempt to account for the presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
of the usual Irish humour in this, to the devotee, most
solemn offering; but I point out the undoubted nature
of the offerings and their service in the identification
of their owners&mdash;a service which implies their power
to bear witness in spirit-land to the pilgrimage of those
who deposited them during lifetime at the sacred
well.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Now, in all these cases there is an original and
a secondary, or derivative, form of the superstition,
and it is our object to trace out which is which. Do
the rags deposited at wells symbolise offerings to the
local deity? If so, they bring us within measurable
distance of a cult which rests upon faith in the power
of natural objects to harm or render aid to human
beings. Does the question of first-foot rest upon the
colour of the hair or upon the sex of the person? I
think, looking at all the examples I have been able to
examine, that colour is really the older basis of the
superstition, and, if so, ethnological considerations are
doubtless the root of it. Again, if the eldest son of
the deceased owner of bees appears in the earliest form
of the death-telling ceremony, we have an interesting
fragment of the primitive house-ritual of our ancestors.</p>

<p>When, however, we come upon the worship of
local deities, when we can suggest ethnological
elements in folklore, and when we can speak of the
house-father, and can see that duties are imposed upon
him by traditional custom, unknown to any rules of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
civilised society, we are in the presence of facts older
than those of historic times. It is thus that folklore
so frequently points back to the past before the age of
history. Over and over again we pause before the
facts of folklore, which, however explained, always
lead us back to some unexplored epoch of history,
some undated period, which has not revealed its
heroes, but which has left us a heritage of its mental
strivings.</p>

<p>The method of using these notes of custom, rite,
and belief for scientific purposes is therefore a very
important matter. It is essential that each single item
should be treated definitely and separately from all
other items, and, further, that the exact wording of the
original note upon each separate item should be kept
intact. There must be no juggling with the record, no
emendations such as students of early literary work
are so fond of attempting. Whatever the record, it
must be accepted. The original account of every
custom and belief is a corpus, not to be tampered
with except for the purpose of scientific analysis, and
then after that purpose has been effected all the parts
must be put together again, and the original restored
to its form.</p>

<p>The handling of each custom or belief and of its
separate parts in this way enables us, in the first place,
to disentangle it from the particular personal or social
stratum in which it happens to have been preserved.
It may have become attached to a place, an object, a
season, a class of persons, a rule of life, and may have
been preserved by means of this attachment. But
because every item of folklore of the same nature is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
not attached to the same agent wherever that particular
item has been preserved, it is important not to stereotype
an accidental association as a permanent one.
Moreover, the modern association is not necessarily the
ancient association, and there is the further difficulty
created by writers on folklore classifying into chapters
of their own creation the items they collect or
discuss.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In the second place, we are enabled to
prepare each item of folklore for the place to which it
may ultimately be found to belong. The first step in
this preparation is to get together all the examples of
any one custom, rite, or belief which have been preserved,
and to compare these examples with each other,
first as to common features of likeness, secondly as
to features of unlikeness. By this process we are
able to restore what may be deficient from the insufficiency
of any particular record&mdash;and such a restoration
is above all things essential&mdash;and to present for
examination not an isolated specimen but a series of
specimens, each of which helps to bring back to
observation some portion of the original. The reconstruction
of the original is thus brought within sight.</p>

<p>Generally, it may be stated that the points of likeness
determine and classify all the examples of one
custom or belief; the points of unlikeness indicate the
line of decay inherent in survivals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
This partial equation and partial divergence between
different examples of the same custom or belief allows a
very important point to be made in the study of survivals.
We can estimate the value of the elements
which equate in any number of examples, and the value
of the elements which diverge; and by noting how
these values differ in the various examples we shall
discover the extent of the overlapping of example with
example, which is of the utmost importance. A given
custom consists, say, of six elements, which by their
constancy among all the examples and by their special
characteristics may be considered as primary elements,
in the form in which the custom has survived. Let us
call these primary elements by algebraical signs, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>. A second example of the same custom has four
of these elements, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and two divergences, which
may be considered as secondary elements, and which
we will call by the signs <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>. A third example has
elements <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and divergences <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>. A further
example has none of the primary elements, but only
divergences <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>. Then the statement of the
case is reduced to the following:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="40%" summary="Table of elements">

    <td class="tdl"><i>m</i>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The first conclusion to be drawn from this is that the
overlapping of the several examples (No. 1 overlapping
No. 2 at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, No. 2 overlapping No. 3 at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> + <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>,
No. 3 overlapping No. 4 at + <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>) shows all these
several examples to be but variations of one original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
custom, example No. 4, though possessing none of the
elements of example No. 1, being the same custom as
example No. 1. Secondly, the divergences <i>g</i> to <i>m</i>
mark the line of decay which this particular custom has
undergone since it ceased to belong to the dominant
culture of the people, and dropped back into the position
of a survival from a former culture preserved only
by a fragment of the people.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>The first of these conclusions is not affected by the
order in which the examples are arranged; whether we
begin with No. 4 or with No. 1, the relationship of
each example to the others, thus proved to be in intimate
association, is the same. The second conclusion
is necessarily dependent upon what we take to be "primary
elements" and "secondary elements;" and the
question is how can these be determined? As a rule it
will be found that the primary elements are the most
constant parts of the whole group of examples, appearing
more frequently, possessing greater adherence to a
common form, changing (when they do change) with
slighter variations; while the secondary elements, on
the other hand, assume many different varieties of form,
are by no means of constant occurrence, and do not
even amongst themselves tend to a common form. The
primary elements, therefore, constitute the form of the
custom which represents the oldest part of the survival.
They alone will help us to determine the origin of the
custom, whether by features represented in the elements
thus brought together or by comparison with ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
custom elsewhere or with survivals elsewhere similarly
reconstituted. Altogether these elements, thus linked
together by the tie of common attributes, are parts of
one organic whole, and it is on this reconstructed
organism we have to rely for the evidence from tradition.</p>

<p>When any given custom or belief has undergone
this double process of analysis of its component parts
and classification of its several elements, another process
has to be undertaken, namely, to ascertain its association
with other customs or beliefs, in the same
country or among the same people, each of which customs
or beliefs, being treated in exactly the same manner,
is found to exhibit some degree of relationship in
origin, condition, or purpose to the whole group under
examination. In this way classification, analysis, and
association go hand in hand as the necessary methods
of studying survivals. Without analysis we cannot
properly arrive at a classification; without classification
we cannot work out the association of survivals.</p>

<p>The process is perhaps highly technical and complicated.
It may not be of interest to all to discuss the
process by which results are attained when what is
most desired are the results themselves. But in truth
the two parts of this study cannot well be separated.
To judge of the validity of the results one must know
what the process has been, and too often results are
jumped at without warrant; items of custom and usage
or of belief and myth are docketed as belonging to a
given phase of culture, a given group of people, when
they have no right to such a place in the history of
man. It is not only distasteful to the inquirer, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
almost impossible to dislodge any item of folklore once
so placed, and thus much of the value of the material
supplied by folklore is lost or discounted.</p>

<p>Custom, rite, and belief treated in this fashion become
veritable monuments of history&mdash;a history too
ancient to have been recorded in script, too much an
essential part of the folk-life to have been lost to tradition.
We may hope to restore therefrom the surviving
mosaic of ancient institutions, ancient law, and
ancient religion, and we may further hope, with this
mosaic to work upon, to restore much of the entire
fabric which has been lying so many centuries beneath
the accumulated and accumulating mass of new developments
representing the civilisation of the Western
world.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>It is only here that we can discover the point where
we may properly commence the work of comparative
folklore. An item of folklore which stands isolated is
practically of no use for scientific investigation. It
may be, as we have seen, that the myth is in its
primary stage as a sacred belief among primitive
people, in its secondary or folk-tale stage as a sacred
memory of what was once believed, in its final or
legendary stage when it does duty in preserving the
memory of a hero or a place of abiding interest. It
may be, as we have seen, that the custom, rite, or
belief is a mere formula without purpose or result,
a mere traditional expression of a purpose without
formula or result, a mere statement of result without
formula or purpose. We must know the exact position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
of each item before we begin to compare, or we may
be comparing absolutely unlike things. The exact
position of each item of folklore is not to be found
from one isolated example. It has first to be restored
to its association with all the known examples of its
kind, so that the earliest and most complete form may
be recorded. That is the true position to which it has
been reduced as a survival. This restored and complete
example is then in a position to be compared
either with similar survivals in other countries on the
same level of culture, or within the same ethnological
or political sphere of influence, or with living customs,
rites, or beliefs of peoples of a more backward state
of culture or in a savage state of culture. Comparison
of this kind is of value. Comparison of a less technical
or comprehensive kind may be of value in the hands
of a great master; but it is often not only valueless
but mischievous in the hands of less experienced writers,
who think that comparison is justified wherever similarity
is discovered.</p>

<p>Similarity in form, however, does not necessarily
mean similarity in origin. It does not mean similarity
in motive. Customs and rites which are alike in
practice can be shown to have originated from quite
different causes, to express quite different motifs, and
cannot therefore be held to belong to a common class,
the elements of which are comparable. Thus to take
a very considerable custom, to be found both in folk-tales
and in usage, the succession of the youngest son,
it is pretty clear that among European peoples it
originated in the tribal practice of the elder sons going
out of the tribal household to found tribal households<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
of their own, thus leaving the youngest to inherit the
original homestead. But among savage peoples where
the youngest son inherits the homestead, he does not
do so because of a tribal custom such as that to be
found in the European evidence. It is because of the
conditions of the marriage rites. Thus among the
Kafir peoples of South Africa</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"the young man of the commonality, who being a young
man has had but little or no means of displaying his sagacity&mdash;a
quality with them most frequently synonymous with
cunning&mdash;commences for himself in a small way. Hence,
too, being polygamous, and his wives being bought with
cattle, his first wife is taken from a position accordant with
that of a young, untried, and poor or comparatively poor
man. Hence also it happens that his wives increase in
number, and in&mdash;so to speak&mdash;position, in accordance with
his wealth, and with his reputation for wisdom and sagacity,
which may have raised him to the rank of headman of a
district, and one of the Chief's counsellors. It is, therefore,
only when old in years that he takes to himself his 'great
wife,' one of greater social and racial position than were his
previous wives, and her son, that is, her eldest son, who is
consequently the father's youngest or nearly his youngest,
becomes his 'great son,' and par excellence the heir. If
the father be a Chief, this son becomes the Chief at his
father's death.</p>

<p>"As, however, subordinate heirs, the father after some
consultation and ceremony chooses out of his other sons,
secondly 'the son of his right hand,' and thirdly, 'the son
of his grandfather.' If the father be a Chief, these two
are after his death accounted as Chiefs in the tribe, subordinate
to the 'great son,' and even if through their
superior energy, the size of the tribe requiring emigration
to pastures new, or other causes, one or both of them break
off, and with their respective inheritance or following form a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
separate tribe or tribes, yet they are federally bound to their
great brother, and their successors to his successors, and
recognise him as their supreme or national Chief. Thus
Krili, the Chief of the Amagcaleka tribe across the Kei, was
also paramount Chief of all the Amaxosas, including his
own tribe, and those this side the Kei, who are divided into
the two great divisions&mdash;each of which includes several
tribes&mdash;of the Amangquika and Amandhlambi, which latter
has among it the Amagqunukwebi, a tribe of Caffre intermingled
with Hottentot blood, and therefore rather looked
down upon."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p></div>

<p>Dr. Nicholson, from whom I quote this evidence,
goes on to say that the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"custom then of the heirship of the youngest, appears to me
to have not unlikely grown up among a polygamous race,
and to have arisen both from considerations of self security
and from those of race and rank."</p></div>

<p>Quite independently of Dr. Nicholson I had come to
the same conclusion;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and Dr. Nicholson, after handsomely
acknowledging my priority in the "discovery,"
very properly alludes to the not unimportant fact of
two workers in the same field coming to like conclusions.
It is remarkable that the same distinction between
the succession of the youngest son and of the
son of the youngest wife appears in folk-tales.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Now
clearly it would be quite wrong to suggest a parallel
between the heirship of the youngest among the Kafir
peoples of Africa and heirship of the youngest among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
the tribal people of early Europe. They are not comparable
at all points, and it is just where the point
of comparison fails that it becomes so important to
science.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>I will take one other example, and this is the important
practice of human sacrifice which looms so
largely in anthropological research, and which is considered
by so good an authority as Schrader to have
taken a prominent place among the Aryans,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> though he
takes his examples, not from language, but from the
unexamined customs of the Greeks, Romans, northerns,
Indians, and Persians. We know more about the development
of sacrifice now that Professor Robertson
Smith has dealt with the Semitic part of the evidence.
Without resting on the fact that the occurrence of human
sacrifice in a country occupied by Aryan-speaking
people does not, of itself alone, imply that the rite
was Aryan, it is far more important to point out that
among the higher races "the feeling that the slaying
involves a grave responsibility and must be justified by
divine permission" appears, and "care was taken to
slay the victim without bloodshed, or to make believe
that it had killed itself."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> This feeling marks distinctly
the Greek sacrifice as at Thargelia and in the
Leukadian ceremony, the Roman sacrifice at the
Tarpeian Rock, the sacrifice at the Valhalla rock of the
northerns, while among the Hindus there is much to
show that the idea of human sacrifice in some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
the early writings is a literary borrowing from the
Hebrews; and that if it ever prevailed among the
Aryas of India it was very early superseded by
the sacrifice of animals.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Colonel Dalton has given
good reasons for his views "that the Hindus derived
from the aboriginal races the practice of human
sacrifices."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Although, then, Greek ritual and Greek
myth are full of legends which tell of sacrifices
once human, but afterwards commuted into sacrifices
where some other victim is slain or the dummy of
a man is destroyed;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> although the significant Hindu
ceremonial of so throwing the limbs of an animal
slaughtered to be burnt with the dead that every
limb lies upon a corresponding part of the corpse;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
although Teuton, Celt, and Norse<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> are credited
with the practice by authorities not to be questioned,
it appears by the evidence that the European
form of human sacrifice has little in common with
the savage form except in the nature of the victim. It
occurred, as Grimm states, when some great disaster,
some heinous crime, had to be retrieved or purged, a
kind of sacrifice, says Mr. Lang, not necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
savage except in its cruelty; and the victims were not
tribesmen, but captive enemies, purchased slaves, or
great criminals.</p>

<p>These two examples will serve as warning against the
too general acceptance of the custom and belief of savage
and barbaric races, as identical with the custom and
belief of early or primitive man. Such identification is
in the main correct; but it is correct not because it has
been proved by the best methods to be so, but because,
of all possible explanations, this is the only one that
meets the general position in a satisfactory manner.
In many cases, however, it is monstrously incorrect,
and it is the incorrect conclusion which weighs far more
against the acceptance of the results of folklore than
do the correct conclusions in its favour.</p>

<p>The work which has to be accomplished by the comparative
method of research is of such magnitude that
it needs to be considered. The labour and research
might in point of volume be out of proportion to the
results, and it may be questioned, as it has already been
questioned by inference, whether it is worth the while.
The first answer to this objection is that all historical
investigation is justified, however much the labour,
however extensive the research. Secondly, considering
the very few results which the study of folklore has
hitherto produced upon the investigations into prehistoric
Europe, it must be worth while for the student
of custom and belief to conduct his experiments upon
a recognised plan in order to get at the secret of
man's place in the struggle for existence, which is determined
more by psychological than by physical
phenomena. Thirdly, if the psychical anthropology<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
of prehistoric times is to be sought for in the customs
and beliefs of modern savages, it is of vital importance
to anthropological science that this should be established
by methods exactly defined. Whatever of traditional
custom and belief is capable of bearing the test and of
being definitely labelled as belonging to prehistoric
man, becomes thereafter the data for the psychical
anthropology of civilised man. Edmund Spenser understood
this when his official duties took him among the
"wild" Irish. "All the customs of the Irish," he says,
"which I have often noted and compared with that I
have read, would minister occasion of a most ample
discourse of the original of them, and the antiquity of
that people, which in truth I think to be more ancient
than most that I know in this end of the world; so as if
it were in the handling of some man of sound judgment
and plentiful reading, it would be most pleasant and
profitable."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Comparative folklore, then, to be of value must be
based upon scientific principles. The unmeaning custom
or belief of the peasantry of the Western world of civilisation
must not be taken into the domains of savagery
or barbarism for an explanation without any thought as
to what this action really signifies to the history of the
custom or belief in question. No doubt the explanation
thus afforded is correct in most cases, and perhaps it
was necessary to begin with the comparative method in
order to understand the importance and scope of the
study of apparently worthless material. A new stage in
comparative folklore must now be entered upon. It
must be understood what the effective comparison of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
traditional peasant custom or belief with a savage
custom or belief really amounts to. The process
includes the comparison of an isolated custom or belief
belonging, perhaps secretly, to a particular place, a
particular class of persons, or perhaps a particular
family or person, with a custom or belief which is part
of a whole system belonging to a savage race or tribe;
of a custom or belief whose only sanction is tradition,
the conservative instinct to do what has been done by
one's ancestors, with a custom or belief whose sanction
is the professed and established polity or religion of a
people; of a custom or belief which is embedded in a
civilisation, of which it is not a part and to which it is
antagonistic, with a custom or belief which helps to
make up the civilisation of which it is part. In carrying
out such a comparison, therefore, a very long journey
back into the past of the civilised race has been performed.
For unless it be admitted that civilised people
consciously borrow from savages and barbaric peoples
or constantly revert to a savage original type of mental
and social condition, the effect of such a comparison is
to take back the custom or belief of the modern peasant
to a date when a people of savage or barbaric culture
occupied the country now occupied by their descendants,
the peasants in question, and to equate the custom or
belief of this ancient savage or barbaric culture with
the custom or belief of modern savage or barbaric
culture. The line of comparison is not therefore simply
drawn level from civilisation to savagery; but it consists,
first, of two vertical lines from civilisation and savagery
respectively, drawn to a height scaled to represent the
antiquity of savage culture in modern Europe, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
then the level horizontal line drawn to join the two
vertical lines. Thus the line of comparison is</p>

<p>We thus arrive at some conception of the work to be
accomplished by and involved in comparative folklore.
The results are worth the work. They relate to stages
of culture in the countries of civilisation which are
recoverable by no other means. The stages of culture
are practically lost to history. In ancient Greek and
Roman history, and in ancient Scandinavian history,
there are priceless fragments of information which tell
us much. But these fragments are not the complete
story, and they belong to relatively small areas of
European history. Every nation has the right to go
back as far in its history as it is possible to reach. It
can only do this by the help of comparative folklore.
In our own country we have seen how history breaks
down, and yet historical records in Britain are perhaps
the richest in Europe. The traditional materials known
to us as folklore are the only means left to us, and we
can only properly avail ourselves of these when we have
mastered the methods of science which it is necessary
to use in their investigation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_182_182" id="Footnote_182_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_182_182"><span class="label">[182]</span></a> Mr. MacCulloch, in the title of his interesting book, the <i>Childhood of
Fiction</i>, has emphasised this mischievous idea. I am not convinced to
the contrary by the evidence he gives as to the popularity of the folk-tale
among all peoples (p. 2). Indeed, the book itself is an emphatic testimony
against its title. Mr. MacCulloch evidently began with the idea
that the folk-tale belonged to the domain of fiction. Thus the opening
words of his book are: "Folk-tales are the earliest form of romantic
and imaginative literature&mdash;the unwritten fiction of early man and of
primitive people in all parts of the world;" whereas as he nears the end
of his study he observes: "Thus, in their origin, folk-tales may have
had some other purpose than mere amusement; they may have embodied
the traditions, histories, beliefs, ideas, and customs of men at an early
stage of civilisation" (p. 451). Mr. MacCulloch himself proves this to
be the case, and it is therefore all the more unfortunate that he should
have stamped his very important study with the word "fiction."</p></div>

most graphically in its opening sentences. The narrator begins his tale
by saying: "I speak of the long time past; hear! It is written in our old-time-palaver-books&mdash;I
do not say <i>then</i>; in old time the Vey people had
no books, but the old men told it to their children and they kept it;
afterwards it was written" (<i>Journ. Ethnol. Soc.</i>, N.S., vi. 354). A parallel
to this comes from Ireland: "What I have told your honour is true; and
if it stands otherwise in books, it's the books which are wrong. Sure
we've better authority than books, for we have it all handed down from
generation to generation" (Kohl's <i>Travels in Ireland</i>, 140).</p></div>

to account for the difference between white and black races. It is as
follows: "In the beginning of the world God created three white men
and three white women, and three black men and three black women.
In order that these twelve human souls might not thenceforth complain
of Divine partiality and of their separate conditions, God elected that
they should determine their own fates by their own choice of good and
evil. A large calabash or gourd was placed by God upon the ground,
and close to the side of the calabash was also placed a small folded
piece of paper. God ruled that the black man should have the first
choice. He chose the calabash, because he expected that the calabash,
being so large, could not but contain everything needful for himself.
He opened the calabash, and found a scrap of gold, a scrap of iron, and
several other metals of which he did not understand the use. The
white man had no option. He took, of course, the small folded piece of
paper, and discovered that, on being unfolded, it revealed a boundless
stock of knowledge. God then left the black men and women in the
bush, and led the white men and women to the seashore. He did not
forsake the white men and women, but communicated with them every
night, and taught them how to construct a ship, and how to sail from
Africa to another country. After a while they returned to Africa with
various kinds of merchandise, which they bartered to the black men and
women, who had the opportunity of being greater and wiser than the
white men and women, but who, out of sheer avidity, had thrown away
their chance."</p></div>

as primitive science to the myth as fairy tale, from the savage to the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_209_209" id="Footnote_209_209"></a><a href="#FNanchor_209_209"><span class="label">[209]</span></a> It will be interesting, I think, to preserve here one or two instances
of the actual practice of telling traditional tales in our own country.
Mr. Hartland has referred to the subject in his <i>Science of Fairy Tales</i>,
but the following instances are additional to those he has noted, and
they refer directly back to the living custom. They are all from Scotland,
and refer to the early part of last century. "In former times,
when families, owing to distance and other circumstances, held little
intercourse with each other through the day, numbers were in the habit
of assembling together in the evening in one house, and spending the
time in relating the tales of wonder which had been handed down to
them by tradition" (Kiltearn in Ross and Cromarty; Sinclair, <i>Statistical
Account of Scotland</i>, xiv. 323). "In the last generation every farm and
hamlet possessed its oral recorder of tale and song. The pastoral
habits of the people led them to seek recreation in listening to, and in
rehearsing the tales of other times; and the senachie and the bard were
held in high esteem" (Inverness-shire, <i>ibid.</i>, xiv. 168). "In the winter
months, many of them are in the habit of visiting and spending the
evenings in each other's houses in the different hamlets, repeating the
songs of their native bard or listening to the legendary tales of some
venerable senachie" (Durness in Sutherlandshire, <i>ibid.</i>, xv. 95).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>lthough the great mass of folklore rests upon
tradition and tradition alone, an important aid
to tradition comes from certain psychological
conditions which we must now consider. At an early
stage all students of folklore will have discovered that
it is not entirely to tradition that folklore is indebted
for its material. There are still people capable of
thinking, capable of believing, in the primitive way
and in the primitive degree. Such people are of
course the descendants of long ancestors of such
people&mdash;people whose minds are not attuned to the
civilisation around them; people, perhaps, whose
minds have been to an extent stunted and kept back
by the civilisation around them. There can be no
doubt that civilisation and all it demands of mankind
acts as a deterrent upon the minds of some living
within the civilisation zone, and belonging apparently
to the civilised society. This is the root cause of
some of the lunacy and much of the crime which apparently
exists as a necessary adjunct of civilisation,
and it leads to various forms of thought inconsistent
with the knowledge and ideas of the age.
When these forms of thought are not concentrated into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
a new religious sect by the operation of social laws,
they become what is sometimes called mere superstition,
that kind of superstition which consists of using the
same power of logic to a narrow set of facts which primitive
man was in the habit of using, and thus repeating
in this age the methods of primitive science. We
cannot quite understand this in the age of railways
and schools and inventions, but it will be understood
better if we go back for only a generation or two to
those parts of our country which are most remote from
civilising influences, and obtain some information as to
their condition.</p>

<p>This cannot be better accomplished than by referring
to a Scottish author writing, in 1835, of the superstitions
then prevailing in Scotland. "Our whole
genuine records," says Dalyell,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"teem with the most repulsive pictures of the weakness,
bigotry, turbulence, and fierce and treacherous cruelty of the
populace. False and corrupt innovations of literature, a compound
of facts and fiction, intermingling the old and the new
in heterogeneous assemblage, would persuade us to think
much more of our forefathers than they thought of themselves.
Scotland, until the most modern date, was an utter stranger
to civilisation, presenting a sterile country with a famished
people, wasted by hordes of mendicants readier to seize than
to solicit&mdash;void of ingenious arts and useful manufactures,
possessed of little skill and learning, plunged in constant
war and rapine, full of insubordination, disturbing public
rule and private peace. For waving pendants, flowing
draperies, brilliant colours, eagles' feathers, herons' plumes,
feasts or festivals so splendid in imagination, let naked limbs,
scanty, sombre garments to elude discovery by the foe, bits of
heath stuck in bonnets if they had them, precarious sustenance,
abject humility and all those hardships inseparable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
from uncultivated tribes and countries be instituted as a juster
portrait of earlier generations."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p></div>

<p>This statement as to Scotland is correctly drawn from
social conditions which have now passed away, but
which, down to the beginning of last century, belonged
to the ordinary life of the people. Thus it is recorded
that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"over all the highlands of Scotland, and in this county in
common with others, the practice of building what are called
head-dykes was of very remote antiquity. The head-dyke
was drawn across the head of a farm, when nature had
marked the boundary betwixt the green pastures and that
portion of hill which was covered totally or partially with
heath. Above this fence the young cattle, the horses, the
sheep and goats were kept in the summer months. The
milch cows were fed below, except during the time the farmer's
family removed to the distant grazings called sheilings.
Beyond the head-dyke little attention was paid to boundaries.
These enclosures exhibit the most evident traces of extreme
old age."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>In Ireland the same conditions obtained so late as the
sixteenth century; the native Irish retained their wandering
habits, tilling a piece of fertile land in the spring,
then retiring with their herds to the booleys or dairy
habitations, generally in the mountain districts in the
summer, and moving about where the herbage afforded
sustenance to their cattle.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> An eighteenth-century
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>traveller in Ireland was assured that the quarter called
Connaught was "inhabited by a kind of savages," and
there is record of the capture of a hairy dwarf near
Longford, who appears hardly to belong to civilisation.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
Similar conditions obtained in the northern counties of
England, and in other parts.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Special circumstances
kept the borderland outside the influences of ordinary
civilised thought and control, and these circumstances
have been recorded by an eighteenth-century observer,
from whom I will quote one or two facts as to the mode
of life of these people: "That they might be more
invisible during their outrodes and consequently less
liable to the effects of their enemies' vigilance, the
colour of their cloathes resembled that of the scenes of
their employment or of their season of action, that is,
of a brown heath and cloudy evening. Thus examples
of what might condemn their conduct were never
offered to them, and immemorial custom seemed as it
were to sanctify their wildness. Every border-man,
almost without exception, was brought up in a state
which we would call unhappy, and every circumstance
of his life tended to confirm his partiality for an uncertain
bed and unprovided diet."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The evidence which this acute observer collected led
him to conclude that the "almost uniform train of
circumstances which affected these countries from their
border situation, and the little difference there was
between one of the dark ages and another, strongly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
induce me to believe that the Northern people were
little altered in manners from very remote times to those
immediately <ins class="correction" title="'preceeding' in original">preceding</ins>
the reign of Queen Elizabeth," and this is confirmed by what we
actually find from the report of the Commissioners appointed
to settle the peace of the Marches by fixed and established
ordinances, who collected "their ordinances from the
traditional accounts of ancient usages that had been
sanctified as laws by the length of time which they had
endured. These laws were different from most others,
nay, almost peculiar to the men to whom they belonged."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
I need not continue these notes as to the backwardness
of portions of the country compared with its
general level of culture, because I have dealt with the
evidence elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> What I am anxious to point out
here is that the faculty of such people as these to think,
not in terms of modern science but in terms of their
own psychological conditions, must have been pronounced.
If they ever put the question to themselves
as to the origin of things, they would answer themselves
according to the life impressions they were then
receiving, and according to the limited range of their
actual knowledge. As with the creators of the traditional
myths, the scientific inquirers of primitive times,
so with these non-advanced people of later times, they
would deal with the problems they did not understand
in fashions suitable to their own understanding. It
has always appeared to me that the impressions of the
surrounding life are not sufficiently regarded in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
influence upon primitive thought. They press down
upon the mind, and enclose it within barriers so that it
can only act through these surroundings. Child-life is,
in this respect, much the same as the life of primitive
man. A child thinks and acts in terms of his nursery,
his school, or his playground. Thus a memory of my
own is to the point. When quite a child, probably
about eight or nine years old, I was entrusted with
the changing of a small cheque drawn by my father in
a country town where we were staying. I had never
seen a cheque before. I remember the ceremony of
writing it and the care with which the necessary
instructions were given to me, and I remember the
amazement with which I received the golden sovereigns.
But my mind dwelt upon this strange thing
called a cheque, and after a time I deliberately came to
the conclusion that my father was allowed to get money
for these cheques on condition only that he wrote them
without a mistake and without a blot. The conception
is absurd until we come to analyse the cause of it. My
young life at that time was receiving its greatest impressions,
its all-absorbing impressions, from my
school exercises in writing. It was a copybook life for
the time being, and when I turned to ask my question
as to origins, as every human being has asked himself
in turn, I could express myself only in copybook
terms. It is so with the primitive mind. It can only
express itself in the terms of its greatest impressions,
and it is in this way that primitive animism, sympathetic
magic and other conceptions obtained from
the results of anthropological research, are to be found
in much the same degree wherever humanity is found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
in primitive conditions. As Mr. Hickson puts it so
well: "Just as the little black baby of the negro, the
brown baby of the Malay, the yellow baby of the
Chinaman, are in face and form, in gestures and
habits, as well as in the first articulate sound they
mutter, very much alike, so the mind of man, whether
he be Aryan or Malay, Mongolian or Negrito, has, in
the course of its evolution, passed through stages
which are practically identical. In the intellectual
childhood of mankind natural phenomena, or some
other causes, of which we are at present ignorant, have
induced thoughts, stories, legends, and myths, that in
their essentials are identical among all the races of the
world with which we are acquainted;"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> or to take one
other example from the experience of travellers, Mr.
Mitchell, speaking of the Australians, says: "I found a
native still there, and on my advancing towards him
with a twig he shook another twig at me, waving it
over his head, and at the same time intimating with it
that we must go back. He and the boy then threw up
dust at us with their toes (<i>cf.</i> 2 Sam. xvi. 13).
These various expressions of hostility and defiance
were too intelligible to be mistaken. The expressive
pantomime of the man showed the identity of the
human mind, however distinct the races or different the
language."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>This identity is shown in many other ways to have
been operating, perhaps to be operating still, upon
minds not attuned to the civilisation around them.
The resistance of agriculturists to change is well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
known.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The crooked ridges of the open-field system
were believed to be necessary because they were supposed
to deceive the devil,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> while a superstitious dislike
was entertained against winnowing machines, because
they were supposed to interfere with the elements.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
This is nothing but a modern example of sympathetic
magic produced by the introduction of the new
machine.</p>

<p>I need not go through the researches of the masters
of anthropology to explain what the psychological
evidence exactly amounts to, and the realms of primitive
thought and experience which it connotes.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> It
will, however, be useful for the purpose of our present
study, if we can find among the peasantry of our
country (perchance from those districts where we have
noted conditions under which primitive thought might
retain a continuous hold) examples of belief or superstition
which belongs rather to psychological than to
traditional influences. The interpretation of dreams, the
belief in spirit apparitions, the practice of charms, all
belong to this branch of our subject, though I shall
illustrate the points I wish to bring out by reference to
less common departments.</p>

<p>It was only in the seventeenth century that a learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
divine of the Church of England was shocked to hear
one of his flock repeat the evidence of his pagan beliefs
in language which is as explicit as it is amusing; and I
shall not be accused of trifling with religious susceptibilities
if I quote a passage from a sermon delivered
and printed in 1659&mdash;a passage which shows not a
departure from Christianity either through ignorance
or from the result of philosophic study or contemplation,
but a sheer non-advance to Christianity, a passage
which shows us an English pagan of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>"Let me tell you a story," says the Reverend Mr.
Pemble, "that I have heard from a reverend man out
of the pulpit, a place where none should dare to tell a
lye, of an old man above sixty, who lived and died in
a parish where there had bin preaching almost all his
time.... On his deathbed, being questioned by a
minister touching his faith and hope in God, you would
wonder to hear what answer he made: being demanded
what he thought of God, he answers that he was a good
old man; and what of Christ, that he was a towardly
youth; and of his soule, that it was a great bone in his
body; and what should become of his soule after he
was dead, that if he had done well he should be put into
a pleasant green meadow."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Of the four articles of this singular creed, the first
two depict an absence of knowledge about the central
features of Christian belief, the latter two denote the
existence of knowledge about some belief not known to
English scholars of that time. If it had so happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
that the Reverend Mr. Pemble had thought fit to tell
his audience only of the first two articles of this creed,
it would have been difficult to resist the suggestion
that they presented us merely with an example of
stupid, or, perhaps, impudent, blasphemy caused by
the events of the day. But the negative nature of the
first two items of the creed is counterbalanced by the
positive nature of the second two items; and thus this
example shows us the importance of considering
evidence as to all phases of non-belief in Christianity.</p>

<p>Passing on to the two items of positive belief, it is
to be noted that the soul resident in the body in the
shape of a bone is no part of the early European belief,
but equates rather with the savage idea which identifies
the soul with some material part of the body, such as
the eyes, the heart, or the liver; and it is interesting to
note in this connection that the backbone is considered
by some savage races, <i>e.g.</i>, the New Zealanders, as
especially sacred because the soul or spiritual essence
of man resides in the spinal marrow.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> And there is a
well-known incident in folk-tales which seems to owe
its origin to this group of ideas. This is where the
hero having been killed, one of his bones tells the
secret of his death, and thus acts the part of the soul-ghost.</p>

<p>In the pleasant green fields we trace the old faiths of
the agricultural peasantry which, put into the words of
Hesiod, tell us that "for them earth yields her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
increase; for them the oaks hold in their summits acorns,
and in their midmost branches bees. The flocks bear
for them their fleecy burdens ... they live in
<i>unchanged happiness</i>, and need not fly across the sea in
impious ships"&mdash;faiths which are in striking contrast to
the tribal warrior's conception as set forth by the Saxon
thane of King Eadwine of Northumbria. "This life,"
said this poetical thane, "is like the passage of a bird
from the darkness without into a lighted hall where you,
O King, are seated at supper, while storms, and rain,
and snow rage abroad. The sparrow flying in at our
door and straightway out at another is, while within,
safe from the storm; but soon it vanishes into the darkness
whence it came."</p>

<p>Such faiths as these, indeed, show us primitive ideas
at their very roots. This seventeenth-century pagan
depended upon himself for his faith. He worked out
his own ideas as to the origin of soul and heaven and
God and Christ. They were terms that had filtered
down to him through the hard surroundings of his life,
and he set to work to define them in the fashion of the
primitive savage. We meet with other examples. Thus
among the superstitions of Lancashire is one which
tells us of the lingering belief in a long journey after
death, when food is necessary to support the soul. A
man having died of apoplexy, near Manchester, at a
public dinner, one of the company was heard to remark:
"Well, poor Joe, God rest his soul! He has at least
gone to his long rest wi' a belly full o' good meat, and
that's some consolation," and perhaps a still more remarkable
instance is that of the woman buried in
Cuxton Church, near Rochester, who directed by her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
will that the coffin was to have a lock and key, the key
being placed in her dead hand, so that she might be
able to release herself at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>These people simply did not understand civilised
thought or civilised religion. To escape from the
pressure of trying to understand they turned to think
for themselves, and thinking for themselves merely
brought them back to the standpoint of primitive
thought. It could hardly be otherwise. The working
of the human mind is on the same plane wherever and
whenever it operates or has operated. The difference
in results arises from the enlarged field of observation.
When the Suffolk peasant set to work to account for
the existence of stones on his field by asserting that the
fields produced the stones, and for the origin of the so-called
"pudding-stone" conglomerate, that it was a
mother stone and the parent of the pebbles,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> he was
beginning a first treatise on geology; and when
the Hampshire peasant attributes the origin of the
tutsan berries to having germinated in the blood of
slaughtered Danes,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> other counties following the same
thought, I am not at all sure that he is not beginning
all over again the primitive conception of the origin
of plants.</p>

<p>This beginning shows the mark of the primitive
mind, and that it was operating in a country dominated
by scientific thought is the phenomenon which makes
it so important to consider psychological conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>among the problems of folklore. They account for
some beliefs which may not contain elements of pure
tradition. When the Mishmee Hill people of India
affirm of a high white cliff at the foot of one of the hills
that approaches the Burhampooter that it is the remains
of the "marriage feast of Raja Sisopal with the
daughter of the neighbouring king, named Bhismak,
but she being stolen away by Krishna before the ceremony
was completed, the whole of the viands were left
uneaten and have since become consolidated into their
present form,"<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> we can understand that the belief is
in strict accord with the primitive conditions of thought
of the Mishmee people. Can we understand the same
conditions of the parallel English belief concerning the
stone circle known as "Long Meg and her daughters,"<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
and of that at Stanton Drew;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> or of the allied beliefs
in Scotland that a huge upright stone, Clach Macmeas,
in Loth, a parish of Sutherlandshire, was hurled to
the bottom of the glen from the top of Ben Uarie by
a giant youth when he was only one month old;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and
in England that "the Hurlers," in Cornwall, were
once men engaged in the game of hurling, and were
turned into stone for playing on the Lord's Day; that
the circle, known as "Nine Maidens," were maidens
turned into stone for dancing on the Lord's Day;<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> that
the stone circle at Stanton Drew represents serpents
converted into stones by Keyna, a holy virgin of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
fifth century;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and that the so-called snake stones found
at Whitby were serpents turned into stones by the
prayers of the Abbess Hilda.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> These are only examples
of the kind of beliefs entertained in all parts of the
United Kingdom,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and they seem based upon psychological,
rather than traditional conditions.</p>

<p>The giant and the witch, or wizard, are terms applied
to the unknown personal agent. "The two standing
stones in the neighbourhood of West Skeld are said to
be the metamorphosis of two wizards or giants, who
were on their way to plunder and murder the inhabitants
of West Skeld; but not having calculated
their time with sufficient accuracy, before they could
accomplish their purpose, or retrace their steps to their
dark abodes, the first rays of the morning sun appeared,
and they were immediately transformed, and remain to
the present time in the shape of two tall moss-grown
stones of ten feet in height."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> This is paralleled by
the Merionethshire example of a large drift of stones
about midway up the Moelore in Llan Dwywe,
which was believed to be due to a witch who "was
carrying her apron full of stones for some purpose
to the top of the hill, and the string of the apron
broke, and all the stones dropped on the spot, where
they still remain under the name of Fedogaid-y-Widdon."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
Giant and witch in these cases are generic
terms by which the popular mind has conveyed a conception
of the origin of these strange and remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
monuments, whether natural or constructed by a long-forgotten
people; and we cannot doubt that such beliefs
are generated by the peasantry of civilisation from a
mental conception not far removed from that of the
primitive savage. Neither their religion nor their education
was concerned with such things, so the peasants
turned to their own realm and created a myth of origins
suitable to their limited range of knowledge.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be urged that such beliefs as these
are on the borderland of psychological and traditional
influences. Witches and giants certainly belong to
tradition, but on the other hand they are the common
factors of the natural mind which readily attributes personal
origins to impersonal objects. I am inclined on
the whole to attribute the beliefs attachable to the unexplained
boulders or unknown monoliths to the eternal
questionings in the minds of the uncultured peasants of
uncivilised countries similar to those of the unadvanced
savage. That the peasant of civilisation should confine
his questionings to the by-products of his surroundings
and not to the greater subjects which occupy
the minds of savages, is only because the greater
subjects have already been answered for him by the
Christian Church.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
There is a point, however, where psychological and
traditional conditions are in natural conjunction, and
I will just refer to this. That matters of legal importance
should be preserved by the agency of tradition
has already been shown to belong to that part of history
for which there are no contemporary records, and its
importance in this connection has been proved. Equally
important from the psychological side is the fact that
law is also preserved by tradition where people are
unaccustomed to the use of writing, or by reason of
their occupation have little use for writing. To illustrate
this, I will quote an excellent note preserved by
a writer on Cornish superstitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is an old 'vulgar error'&mdash;that no man can swear
as a witness in a court of law to any thing he has seen
through glass. This is based upon the formerly universal
use of blown glass for windows, in which glass the constant
recurrence of the greenish, and barely more than semi-transparent
bull's eyes, so much distorted the view that it
was unsafe for a spectator through glass to pledge his oath
to what he saw going on outside. Now, through our present
glass, this belief is relegated to the region of forgotten things,
but nevertheless it has hold on Westcountry people still. I
was, some years since, investigating the case of a derelict
ship which had been found off the Scilly Islands, and towed
by the pilots into a safe anchorage for the night. Next
morning the pilots going out to complete their salvage, saw
some men on board the derelict casting off the anchor rope
by which they had secured her, but they distinctly declined
to swear to the truth of what they had seen, and it turned
out that they had seen through glass, by which they meant
a telescope. In the same case I found that when these pilots
(men intelligent much beyond the average, as all Scillonians
are) had, on boarding the derelict (which had, of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
been deserted by her crew), found a living dog, they had
deliberately thrown it overboard. They explained this act of
cruelty to me by saying that a ship was not derelict if on
board of her was found alive 'man, woman, child, dog, or
cat.' And it turned out, on after-investigation, that these
were the very words used in an obsolete Act of Parliament
of one of the early Plantagenet kings, forgotten centuries
ago by the English people, but borne in mind as a living fact
by the Scillonians."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p></div>

<p>In some special departments elementary psychological
conditions operate in a considerable degree&mdash;operate
to produce not waifs and strays of primitive thought
and belief, but whole classes. Thus in the curious
accretion of superstition around the objects connected
with church worship, the same agencies are at work.
The general characteristic of popular beliefs which
originated with, or have grown up around the consecrated
objects of the Church, is that such objects are
beneficent in their action when employed for any given
purpose. Thus, as Henderson says of the North of
England, "a belief in the efficacy of the sacred elements
in the Eucharist for the cure of bodily disease is widely
spread." Silver rings, made from the offertory money,
are very generally worn for the cure of epilepsy. Water
that had been used in baptism was believed in West
Scotland to have virtue to cure many distempers; it
was a preventive against witchcraft, and eyes bathed
with it would never see a ghost. Dalyell puts the
evidence very succinctly. "Everything relative to
sanctity was deemed a preservative. Hence the relics
of saints, the touch of their clothes, of their tombs, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
even portions of structures consecrated to divine offices
were a safeguard near the person. A white marble
altar in the church of Iona, almost entire towards the
close of the seventeenth century, had disappeared late
in the eighteenth, from its demolition in fragments to
avert shipwreck." And so what has been consecrated, must not
<ins class="correction" title="'bedesecrated' in original">be desecrated</ins>.
In Leicestershire and Northamptonshire
there is a superstitious idea that the removal
or exhumation of a body after interment bodes death or
some terrible calamity to the surviving members of the
deceased's family.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>In the West of Ireland there were usually found
upon the altars of the small missionary churches one or
more oval stones, either natural waterwashed pebbles
or artificially shaped and very smooth, and these were
held in the highest veneration by the peasantry as
having belonged to the founders of the churches, and were
used for a variety of purposes, as the curing of diseases,
taking oaths upon them, etc.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Similarly the using
of any remains of destroyed churches for profane purposes
was believed to bring misfortune,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> while the land
which once belonged to the church of St. Baramedan,
in the parish of Kilbarrymeaden, county Waterford,
"has long been highly venerated by the common people,
who attribute to it many surprising virtues."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> In 1849
the people of Carrick were in the habit of carrying away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
from the churchyard portions of the clay of a priest's
grave and using it as a cure for several diseases, and
they also boiled the clay from the grave of Father
O'Connor with milk and drank it.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> One of the superstitious
fancies of the Connemara folk in 1825 was
credulity with respect to the gospels, as they are
called, which "they wear round their neck as a
charm against danger and disease. These are prepared
by the priest, and sold by him at the price
of two or three tenpennies. It is considered sacrilege
in the purchaser to part with them at any time,
and it is believed that the charm proves of no efficacy
to any but the individual for whose particular
benefit the priest has blessed it. The charm is written
on a scrap of paper and enclosed in a small cloth bag,
marked on one side with the letters I.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;S. On one
side of the paper is written the Lord's Prayer, and after
it a great number of initial letters."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Such examples could be multiplied indefinitely, but no
folklorist has properly classified such beliefs and endeavoured
to ascertain their place in the science of folklore.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>
It is clear they have arisen not from tradition,
but from a new force acting on minds which were not
yet free to receive new influences without going back
to old methods of thought.</p>

<p>How completely the sanctity of the church exercises
a constant influence upon the minds of men, thus substituting
a new form of belief when older forms were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
thrust on one side by the advance of the new religion,
is perhaps best illustrated by a practice in early
Christian times for giving sanctity to the oath. Among
the Jews the altar in the Temple was resorted to by
litigants in order that the oath might be taken in the
presence of Yahveh himself, and "so powerful was
the impression of this upon the Christian mind, that
in the early ages of the Church there was a popular
superstition that an oath taken in a Jewish synagogue
was more binding and more efficient than anywhere
else."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> In exactly the same way the altar of the
Christian Church is used in popular belief after its use
in Church ceremonial has been discontinued. Thus, to
get in beneath the altar of St. Hilary Church, Anglesey,
by means of an open panel and then turn round
and come out is to ensure life for the coming year,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and
the white marble altar in Iona which has been entirely
demolished by fragments of it being used to avert
shipwreck has already been referred to.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> These are
cases where there has been a throwing back from the
new religion to the objects connected with the old
religion, and they are paralleled by the practice of
Protestants appealing to the Roman Catholic priesthood
for protection against witchcraft, and of Nonconformists
believing that the clergy of the Episcopal
Church possess superior powers over evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
Psychological evidence is therefore important. One
can never be quite sure to what extent civilised man
is free from creating fresh myths in place of acquired
scientific result, and to what extent this influences the
production of primitive beliefs, or allows of the acceptance
of traditional belief on new ground. The great
mass of traditional belief has come through the ages
traditionally, that is, from parent to child, from neighbour
to neighbour, from class to class, from locality to
locality, generation after generation. Occasionally
this main current of the traditional life of a people is
swollen by small side streams from fresh psychological
sources. Individual examples, such as those I have
cited, have perhaps always been present, but their effect
must have died away with the passing of those with
whom they originated. There are, however, stronger
effects than these, coming not from individuals, but
from classes. Thus the votaries and enemies of witchcraft
produced a more lasting effect. Witchcraft, as
Dr. Karl Pearson, I think, conclusively proves, and as
I have helped to prove,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> is founded upon traditional
belief and custom, but its remarkable revival in the
Middle Ages was in the main a psychological phenomenon.
Traditional practices, traditional formul&aelig;,
and traditional beliefs are no doubt the elements of
witchcraft, but it was not the force of tradition which
produced the miserable doings of the Middle Ages and
of the seventeenth century against witches. These
were due to a psychological force, partly generated by
the newly acquired power of the people to read the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
Bible for themselves, and so to apply the witch stories
of the Jews to neighbours of their own who possessed
powers or peculiarities which they could not understand,
and partly generated by the carrying on of traditional
practices by certain families or groups of
persons who could only acquire knowledge of such
practices by initiation or family teaching. Lawyers,
magistrates, judges, nobles, and monarchs are concerned
with witchcraft. These are not minds which
have been crushed by civilisation, but minds which
have misunderstood it or have misused it. It is unnecessary,
and it is of course impossible on this occasion
to trace out the psychic issues which are contained
in the facts of witchcraft, but it may be advisable to
illustrate the point by one or two references.</p>

<p>I will note a few modern examples of the belief in
witchcraft:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In 1879 extraordinary stories were current among the
populace of Caergwrle. Mrs. Braithwaite supplied a Mrs.
Williams with milk, but afterwards refused to serve her, and
the cause was as follows: Mrs. Braithwaite had up to that
time been very successful in churning her butter, but about
a month ago the butter would not come. She tried every
known agency; she washed and dried her bats, but all to no
purpose. The milk would not yield an ounce of butter.
Under the circumstances she said Mrs. Williams had witched
her. The neighbours believed it, and Mrs. Williams was
generally called a witch. Hearing these reports, Mrs.
Williams went to Mrs. Braithwaite to expostulate with her,
when Mrs. Braithwaite said, 'Out, witch! If you don't
leave here, I'll shoot you.' Mrs. Williams thereupon applied
to the Caergwrle bench of magistrates for a protection order
against Mrs. Braithwaite. She assured the Bench she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
in danger, as every one believed she was a witch. The
Clerk: What do they say is the reason? Applicant: Because
she cannot churn the milk. Mr. Kryke: Do they see you
riding a broomstick? Applicant (seriously): No, sir. The
Bench instructed the police officer to caution Mrs. Braithwaite
against repeating the threats."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p></div>

<p>The next example is from Lancashire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At the East Dereham Petty Sessions, William Bulwer,
of Etling Green, was charged with assaulting Christiana
Martins, a young girl, who resided near the Etling Green
toll-bar. Complainant deposed that she was 18 years of
age, and on Wednesday, the 2nd inst., the defendant came
to her and abused her. The complainant, who looks scarce
more than a child, repeated, despite the efforts of the magistrates'
clerk to stop her, and without being in the least
abashed, some of the worst language it was possible to
conceive&mdash;conversation of the most gross description, alleged
to have taken place between herself and the defendant.
They appeared to have got from words to blows and, while
trying to fasten the gate, the defendant hit her across the
hand with a stick. She alleged that there was no cause
for the abuse and the assault, so far as she knew, and in
reply to rigid cross-examination as to the origin of the
quarrel, adhered to this statement. Mrs. Susannah Gathercole
also corroborated the statement as to the assault, adding
that the defendant said the complainant's mother was a witch.
Defendant then blazed forth in righteous indignation, and,
when the witness said she knew no more about the origin of
the quarrel, he said, 'Mrs. Martins is an old witch, gentlemen,
that is what she is, and she charmed me, and I got
no sleep for her for three nights, and one night at half-past
eleven o'clock, I got up because I could not sleep, and went
out and found a "walking toad" under a clod that had been
dug up with a three-pronged fork. That is why I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
rest; she is a bad old woman; she put this toad under
there to charm me, and her daughter is just as bad, gentlemen.
She would bewitch any one; she charmed me, and I
got no rest day or night for her, till I found this "walking
toad" under the turf. She dug a hole and put it there to
charm me, gentlemen, that is the truth. I got the toad out
and put it in a cloth, and took it upstairs and showed it to my
mother, and "throwed" it into the pit in the garden. She
went round this here "walking toad" after she had buried it,
and I could not rest by day or sleep by night till I found
it. The Bench: Do you go to church? Defendant: Sometimes
I go to church, and sometimes to chapel, and sometimes
I don't go nowhere. Her mother is bad enough to
do anything; and to go and put the "walking toad" in the
hole like that, for a man which never did nothing to her, she
is not fit to live, gentlemen, to go and do such a thing; it
is not as if I had done anything to her. She looks at
lots of people, and I know she will do some one harm.
The Chairman: Do you know this man, Superintendent
Symons? Is he sane? Superintendent Symons: Yes, sir;
perfectly."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p></div>

<p>In Somerset belief in witchcraft still lingers in nooks
and corners of the west, as appears from a case brought
before the magistrates of the Wiveliscombe division.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sarah Smith, the wife of a marine store dealer, residing at
Golden Hill, was for some time ill and confined to her bed.
Finding that the local doctor could not cure her, she sent for
a witch doctor of Taunton. He duly arrived by train on
St. Thomas's day. Smith inquired his charge, and was
informed he usually charged 11<i>s.</i>, remarking that unless he
took it from the person affected his incantation would be of
no avail. Smith then handed it to his wife, who gave it to
the witch doctor, and he returned 1<i>s.</i> to her. He then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
proceeded to foil the witch's power over his patient by tapping
her several times on the palm of her hand with his
finger, telling her that every tap was a stab on the witch's
heart. This was followed by an incantation. He then gave
her a parcel of herbs (which evidently consisted of dried bay
leaves and peppermint), which she was to steep and drink.
She was to send to a blacksmith's shop and get a donkey's
shoe made, and nail it on her front door. He then departed."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p></div>

<p>Such examples as these may be added to from various
parts of the country, but they do not compare with the
terrible case at Clonmel, in county Tipperary, which
occurred in 1895. The evidence showed that the
husband, father, and mother of the victim, together with
several other persons, were concerned in this matter,
and one of the witnesses, Mary Simpson, stated "that
on the night of March 14th she saw Cleary forcibly
administer herbs to his wife, and when the woman did
not answer when called upon in the name of the
Trinity to say who she was, she was placed on the fire
by Cleary and the others. Mrs. Cleary did not appear
to be in her right senses. She was raving."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The
whole record of the trial is of the most amazing description,
pointing back to a system of belief which,
if based upon traditional practices, has been fed by
entirely modern influences. Such records as these
stretch back through the ages, and almost every village,
certainly every county in the United Kingdom, has its
records of trials for witchcraft, in which clergy and
layman, judge, jury, and victim play strange parts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
if we consider them as members of a civilised community.
Superstition which has been preserved by
the folk as sacred to their old faiths, preserved by tradition,
has remained the cherished possession, generally
in secret, of those who practise it. The belief in witchcraft
is a different matter. Though it has traditional
rites and practices it has been kept alive by a cruel and
crude interpretation of its position among the faiths
of the Bible, and it has thus received fresh life.</p>

<p>The miserable records of witchcraft illustrate in a
way no other subject can how the human mind, when
untouched by the influences of advanced culture, has
the tendency to revert to traditional culture, and they
demonstrate how strongly embedded in human memory
is the great mass of traditional culture. The outside
civilisation, religious or scientific, has not penetrated
far. Science has only just begun her great work, and
religion has been spending most of her efforts in
endeavouring to displace a set of beliefs which she calls
superstition, by a set of superstitions which she calls
revelation. Not only have the older faiths not been
eradicated by this, but the older psychological conditions
have not been made to disappear. The folklorist
has to make note of this obviously significant
fact, and must therefore deal with both sides of the
question, the traditional and the psychological, and
because by far the greater importance belongs to the
former it does not do to neglect the importance, though
the lesser importance, of the latter.</p>

<p>It assists the student of tradition in many ways.
People who will still explain for themselves in primitive
fashion phenomena which they do not understand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
and who remain content with such primitive explanations
instead of relying upon the discoveries of science,
are just the people to retain with strong persistence the
traditional beliefs and ideas which they obtained from
their fathers, and to acquire other traditional beliefs
and ideas which they obtain from neighbours. One
often wonders at the "amazing toughness" of tradition,
and in the psychological conditions which have
been indicated will be found one of the necessary explanations.</p>

enacted as a result of the Commissioners' work the facts are as follows:
There were certain franchises in North and South Tynedale and Hexhamshire,
by virtue of which the King's writ did not run there. [Tynedale,
though on the English side of the border, was an ancient franchise of the
Kings of Scotland.] In 1293 Edward I. confirmed this grant in favour of
John of Balliol (1 Rot. Parl., 114-16), and the inhabitants took advantage
of this immunity to make forays and commit outrages in neighbouring
counties. In the year 1414, at the Parliament holden at Leicester,
"grievous complaints" of these outrages were made "by the Commons
of the County of Northumberland." It was accordingly provided
(2 Henry V., cap. 5) that process should be taken against such offenders
under the common law until they were outlawed; and that then, upon a
certificate of outlawry made to lords of franchises in North and South
Tynedale and Hexhamshire, the offender's lands and goods should be
forfeited. In 1421 the provisions of this statute were extended to like
offenders in Rydesdale, where also the King's writ did not run (9 Henry V.,
cap. 7). Still these excesses continued in Tynedale. By an enactment
of Henry VII. (2 Henry VII., cap. 9) this "lordship and bounds"
were annexed to the county of Northumberland. "Forasmuch," the
preamble sets forth, "as the inhabitants and dwellers within the lordships
and bounds of North and South Tyndale, not only in their own persons,
but also oftentimes accompanied and confedered with Scottish ancient
enemies to this realm, have at many seasons in time past committed and
done, and yet daily and nightly commit and do, great and heinous
murders, robberies, felonies, depredations, riots and other great trespasses
upon the King our Sovereign lord's true and faithful liege people
and subjects, inhabiters and dwellers within the shires of Northumberland,
Cumberland, and Westmoreland, Exhamshire [<i>sic</i>], the bishopric of
Durham and in a part of Yorkshire, in which treasons, murders, robberies,
felonies, and other the premises, have not in time past in any manner of
form been punished after the order and course of the common law, by
reason of such franchise as was used within the same while it was in the
possession of any other lord or lords than our Sovereign lord, and thus
for lack of punishment of these treasons, murders, robberies and felonies,
the King's true and faithful liege people and subjects, inhabiters and
dwellers within the shires and places before rehearsed, cannot be in any
manner of surety of their bodies or goods, neither yet lie in their own
houses, but either to be murdered or taken or carried into Scotland and
there ransomed, to their great destruction of body and goods, and utter
impoverishing for ever, unless due and hasty remedy be had and found,"
it is therefore provided that North and South Tynedale shall from thenceforth
be gildable, and part of the shire of Northumberland, that no
franchise shall stand good there, and the King's writ shall run, and his
officers and all their warrants be obeyed there as in every other part of
that shire. Further, lessees of lands within the bounds are to enter into
recognisances in two sureties to appear and answer all charges.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONDITIONS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n dealing with the folklore of any country, it is
important to note the general bearing of anthropological
conditions. The earliest inhabitants, to
whom part of the folklore belonged, and the later
peoples, to whom part belonged, have both arrived at
their ultimate point of settlement in the country where
we discover their folklore after being in touch with
many points of the world's surface. They are both
world-people as well as national people&mdash;they belonged
to anthropology before they came under the dominion
of history. This important fact is often or nearly
always neglected. We are apt to treat of Greek and
Roman and Briton, of Cretan, Scandinavian, and
Russian, as bounded by the few thousands of years of
life which have fixed them with their territorial names,
and to ignore all that lies behind this historic period.
There is, as a matter of fact, an immense period behind
it, reckoned according to geological time in millions
of years, and this period, longer in duration, more
strenuous in its influences upon character and mind,
containing more representatives in peoples, societies,
and races than the later period, has affected the later
period to a far greater extent than is generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
conceded or understood. We cannot understand the later
period without knowing something of the earlier
period.</p>

<p>There is more than this; for the dominating political
races occupying European countries to-day were, in
most cases, preceded by a non-political people. Thus,
if we turn to Britain for illustration, we find evidence
of a people physically allied with a race which cannot
be identified with Celt or Teuton,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> philologically allied
with a people which spoke a non-Aryan language,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
arch&aelig;ologically allied with the prehistoric stone-circle
and monolith builders,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and we find custom, belief, and
myth in Britain retaining traces of a culture which is
not Celtic and not Teutonic, and which contains survivals
of the primitive system of totemism.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> These
four independent classes of evidence have to be combined
if we would ascertain the true position they
occupy in the history of Britain, and it is perfectly clear
that, apart from general considerations, a direct appeal
to anthropology is necessary to help out the deficiencies
of both history and folklore. The questions involved in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
totemism alone compel us to this course. It is questionable
whether there is any existing savage or barbaric
people who are non-totemic in the sense of either not
possessing the rudimentary beginnings of totemism, or
not having once possessed a full system of totemism.
Totemism, at one stage or another of its development,
is, in fact, one of the universal elements of man's life,
and all consideration of its traces in civilised countries
must begin with some conception of its origin. Its
origin must refer back to conditions of human life
which are also universal. Special circumstances,
special peoples, special areas could not have produced
totemism unless we proceed to the somewhat violent
conclusion that beginning in one area it has spread
therefrom to all areas. I know of no authority who
advocates such a theory and no evidence in its favour.
We are left therefore with the proposition that the
origin of totemism must be sought for in some universal
condition of human life at one of its very early stages,
which would have produced a state of things from
which would inevitably arise the beliefs, customs, and
social organisations which are included under the term
totemism.</p>

<p>There is therefore ample ground for a consideration
of anthropological conditions as part of the necessary
equipment of the study of folklore as an historical science.
Unfortunately, authorities are now greatly divided on
several important questions in anthropology, and it is
not possible to speak with even a reasonable degree of
certainty on many things. This compels further research
than the mere statement of the present position,
and I find myself obliged even for my present limited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
purpose to suggest many new points beyond the stage
reached by present research. There is one advantage
in this. It allows of a hypothesis by which to present
the subject to the student, and a working hypothesis is
always a great advantage where research is not founded
entirely on actual observation by trained experts in the
field. Where, therefore, I depart from the guidance of
conclusions already arrived at by scholars in this
department of research, it will be in order to substitute
an opinion of my own which I think it is
necessary to consider, and the whole study of the
anthropological problems in their relation to folklore
will assume the shape of a restatement of the entire
case.</p>

<p>I am aware that a subject of this magnitude is too
weighty and far-reaching to be properly considered in
a chapter of a book not devoted to the single purpose,
but it is necessary to attempt a rough statement of the
evidence, though it will take us somewhat beyond the
ordinary domain of folklore; but, while dealing with
the anthropological position at sufficient length to
make a complicated subject clear, if I can do so, I
shall limit both my arguments and the evidence in
support of them to the narrowest limits.</p>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Mr. Wallace, I think, supplies the dominant note of
the anthropological position when he suggests, though
in a strangely unsatisfactory terminology, that it is the
conscious use by man of his experience which causes his
superior mental endowments, and his superior range of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
development.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> We must lay stress upon the important
qualification "conscious." It is conscious use
of experience which is the great factor in man's
progress. It is the greatest possession of man in his
beginning, and has remained his greatest possession
ever since. His experience did not always lead him
to the best paths of progress, but it has led him to
progress.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Wallace did not appreciate the full significance
of this principle. The conscious adoption of a
natural fact, of an observation from nature, or an
assumed observation from nature, for social purposes,
is an altogether different thing from the unconscious
knowledge which man might have been possessed of,
but which he never put to any use in his social development.
Anthropologists must note not the natural facts
known to later man or known to science, but the facts,
or assumed facts, which early man consciously adopted
for his purpose during the long period of his development
from savage to civilised forms of life. The
unconscious acts of mankind are of no use, or of very
little use. It is only the conscious acts that will lead
us along the lines of man's development. Man did
not begin to build up his social system with the
scientific fact of blood kinship through father and
mother, but he evolved a theory of social relationship
which served his purpose until the fact of blood kinship
supplied a better basis. At almost the first point
of origin in savage society we see man acting consciously,
and it is amongst his conscious acts that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
must place those traces of a sort of primitive legislation
which have been found.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>Now this being the basis of anthropological observation,
we have to apply it to the question of man's
earliest progress. It is at its base an economic
question. Primitive economics dominated the movements
and condition of early man in a far more
thorough manner than modern economics affect civilisation,
and between the two systems lies the whole
history of man. It reveals man adapting the social
unit to the productive powers of its food supply, and
developing towards the adaptation of the productive
powers of food supply to the social unit. In the
various stages that accompany this great change, there
is no defined separation of peoples according to stages
of culture, savage, barbaric, or civilised. There is
nothing to suggest that all peoples do not come from
one centre of human life. On the contrary, the
evidence is strong that the primal stages in human
evolution are traceable in all the culture stages, and,
therefore, that they fit in with the general conclusions
of anthropologists and naturalists as to man's origin in
one definite centre, and his gradual spreading out from
that centre.</p>

<p>I will take the chief conclusions arrived at in respect
of this condition of birth at one centre and subsequent
spreading out. Darwin has summarised the problem
between the monogenists and polygenists in a manner
which still ranks as a sufficient statement of the case,
and his conclusion that "all the races of man are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
descended from a single primitive stock"<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> is accepted
by the most prominent naturalists,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and confirmed by
recent discoveries, which go to prove that this primitive
stock began in miocene or pliocene times in the
Indo-Malaysian intertropical lands.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Anthropologists, who have been deeply interested
in the controversy ranging round the origin of man,
have in a remarkable manner neglected to take into
full account the most significant phenomenon of spreading
out.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> They either neglect it altogether, or they
relegate it to so small a place in their argument as to
become a practical neglect. They treat of man as if he
were always in a stationary condition, and exclude the
important condition of movement as an element in his
development. Mr. Spencer's general dictum that geological
changes and meteorological changes, as well as
the consequent changes of flora and fauna, must have
been causing over all parts of the earth perpetual emigrations
and immigrations,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> does not help much, because it
refers to special and cataclysmic events. Lord Avebury,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
though stating the true case, unfortunately contents
himself at the end of his book on prehistoric man with
a short summary of the evidence as to the equipment of
primitive man in mental and social qualities when he
began the great movement, and gives only a few lines
to his conclusion that "there can be no doubt that he
originally crept over the earth's surface little by little,
year by year, just, for instance, as the weeds of Europe
are now gradually but surely creeping over the surface
of Australia."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Keane is the first authority who thinks it appropriate
to commence his treatise on man with an examination
of the facts which show that "the world was
peopled by migration from one centre by pleistocene
man ... who moved about like other migrating
faunas, unconsciously, everywhere following the lines
of least resistance, advancing or receding, and acting
generally on blind impulse rather than of set purpose;"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
and it still remains with Dr. Latham to have
formulated some fixed principles of the migratory movement
in his admirable though, of course, wholly inadequate
summary of man and his migrations. I will
quote the passage in full: "So long as any continental
extremities of the earth's surface remained unoccupied&mdash;the
stream (or rather the enlarging circle of migration)
not having yet reached them&mdash;the <i>primary</i> migration
is going on; and when all have got their complement,
the primary migration is over. During this primary
migration, the relations of man, thus placed in movement
and in the full, early and guiltless exercise of his
high function of subduing the earth, are in conflict<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
with physical obstacles and with the resistance of the
lower animals only. Unless, like Lot's wife, he turn
back upon the peopled parts behind him, he has no
relations with his fellow-men&mdash;at least none arising out
of the claim of previous occupancy. In other words,
during the primary migration, the world that lay before
our progenitors was either brute or inanimate. But
before many generations have passed away, all becomes
full to overflowing, so that men must enlarge their
boundaries at the expense of their fellows. The migrations
that now take place are <i>secondary</i>. They differ
from the primary in many respects. They are slower,
because the resistance is that of humanity to humanity,
and they are violent, because dispossession is the object.
They are partial, abortive, followed by the fusion of
different populations, or followed by their extermination
as the case may be."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> This passage, written so
long ago as 1841, is still applicable to the facts of
modern science, and there is only to add to it that the
migration of man from a common centre, where life
was easy, to all parts of the world, where life has been
difficult, must have been undertaken in order to meet
some great necessity, and must have become possible
by reason of some great force which man alone possessed.
The necessity was economic; the force was
social development. If the movement has not been
geographically ever forward, it has been ethnographically
constant.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Movement always; sometimes the
pressure has come from one direction, sometimes from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
another; sometimes it has caused compression and at
other times expansion; sometimes it has sent humanity
to inhabit regions that required generations of victims
before it could hold its own. At all times the essential
condition of life has been that of constant movement in
face of antagonistic forces.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> In whatever form the
movement has come about, movement of a very definite
character has taken place over an immense period of
time, and sufficient to cover practically the whole earth
with descendants from the original human stock. This
conclusion is enormously strengthened by the accumulating
evidence for the world-wide area covered by the
remains of man's earliest weapon, the worked stone
implement. It is everywhere. It is practically co-extensive
with man's wanderings, and the greatness of
the territory it covers marks it off as another of the
universal relics of man's primitive life. Of no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
weapon or instrument or associated object can this be
said. The bow and arrow are unknown to the Australians
and other peoples; pottery is unknown to the
Bushmen and other peoples; the use of fire in cookery
is not found among the South Sea Islanders, and is
not claimed for other peoples.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> We can get behind
the development of these and other arts and come upon
the ruder people who had not arrived at the stage
they represent. But we cannot get behind the worked
flint. It must have been the chief material cause of
man's success in the migratory movement, and with
the social development accompanying it must have
made migration not only possible, but the only true
method of meeting the earliest economic difficulties.
It also provides us with the elements of a chronological
basis. Behind pal&aelig;olithic times there is an immensity
of time when man struggled with his economic difficulties
and spread out slowly and painfully. During
pal&aelig;olithic times the movement was more rapid and
more general. Obstacles were overcome by pal&aelig;olithic
man becoming superior to his enemies by the
use of weapons, and use of weapons caused, or at all
events aided, the development of social institutions
capable of bearing the new force of movement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
These two factors of economic necessity and social
development are of equal importance in man's history,
and they interlace at all points. They lead straight to
the necessity for always taking count of the fact that
man is primarily a migratory being, and that he has
spread over the earth. Everywhere we find man.
There is no habitable part of the world where he has
not found a home. But we do not find him under
equal conditions everywhere, and the different conditions
afford evidence of the main lines of development.
Roughly speaking, it may be put in this way.
In the savage world the people appear as aborigines,
that is to say, the first and only occupiers of the
territory where they are located. In the barbaric world
the condition of aboriginal settlement is tinged with
the result of conquest, namely, the pushing out or
absorption of the aboriginal folk in favour of a more
powerful and conquering folk. In the political world,
and in the political world only, there is not only the
element of conquest, but the definite aim of conquest,
which is to retain the aboriginal or conquered people
as part of the political fabric necessary to the settlement
of the conqueror, and at the same time to keep
intact the superior position of the conqueror. In the
savage world, society and religion are based upon
locality; in the barbaric world there is the first sign
of the element of kinship consciously used in the effort
of conquest, which dies away gradually as successful
settlement, by which conqueror and conquered become
merged in one people, follows conquest; in the political
world, and in the political world only, kinship is elevated
into a necessary institution, is made sacred to the minds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
of tribesmen, and becomes an essential part of the
religion of the tribe in order to keep the organisation
of the tribal conquerors intact and free from the
perils of dissolution when conquerors and conquered
become members of one political unit. The savage
and barbaric worlds are the homes of the backward
peoples, the non-advanced or fossilised types of early
humanity. The political world is the domain for the
most part of the Aryan-speaking people, and of the
Semitic people, and of those people who in Egypt
within the Mediterranean area, and in China in the
eastern Asian area, have built up civilisations which
have only recently come under scientific observation.</p>

<p>These distinctions are not made by anthropologists
as a rule, yet I cannot but think they are in the main
the true distinctions which must be made if we are to
arrive at any general conception of the progress of man
from savagery to civilisation. The distinctions which
seem to hold the field against those I have suggested,
are those of hunter, pastoral, and agricultural. I say
seem to hold the field, because they have never been
scientifically worked out. They are stated in textbooks
and research work almost as an axiom of anthropology,
but their claim to this position is singularly
weak and unsatisfactory, and has never been
scientifically established. They are only economical
distinctions, not social, and they do not properly
express related stages. Hunting, cattle keeping, and
agriculture are found in almost all stages of social
evolution, and I, for one, deny that in the order they
are generally given, they express anything approaching
to accurate indication of the line of human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
progress. The distinctions I have suggested do not, of
course, contain everything indicative of human progress.
They are the first broad outlines to be filled up
by the details of special peoples, special areas, and
special ages. They involve many sub-stages which
need to be properly worked out, and for which a
satisfactory terminology is required. In the meantime,
as measuring-posts of man's line of progress, they
express the most important fact about man, namely,
that his present enforced stationary condition has
followed upon an enormous period of enforced movement.
That movement has finally resulted in the
presence of man everywhere on the earth's surface.
This has been followed by the continued moving of
savage man within the limited areas to which he has
been finally pushed; by the movement of barbaric
man from one place of settlement to another place
of settlement, again within limited areas; and by
the movement of political man through countries and
continents of vast extent, and the final overlordship
of political man over savage and barbaric man whom
he has subjected and used for his purpose of final
settlement in the civilised form of settlement. It will
be apparent from the terms I have used to express the
three chief stages in man's progress, that I give a
special significance to the use of blood kinship as a
social force, and in the sequel I think this special
significance will be justified.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>No one can properly estimate the tremendous amount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
of movement which preceded these later limitations to
movement. Savage and barbaric races are now hemmed
in by the forces of modern civilisation. This was not
the case even a few hundred years ago, and though we
cannot say when constant movement all over the world
was stayed, we can form some idea of the comparatively
late period when this took place by a contemplation of
the very recent growth of the political civilisations
known to history. At the most, this can only be
reckoned at some ten thousand years. At the back of
this short stretch of time, or of the successive periods
at which the new civilisations have arisen, there are
recollections of great movements and great migrations.
Egypt, Babylonia, India, Persia, Greece, and Rome
have preserved these recollections by tradition, and
tradition has been largely confirmed by arch&aelig;ology.
Celts and Teutons have preserved parallel traditions
which are confirmed by history observed from without.
These traditions and memorials of the migration period
have not been scientifically examined in each case, but
where scholars have touched upon them, great and unexpected
results have been produced.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
There was time enough, before these late and special
movements which led to civilisation, for man, in the
course of peopling the earth, to be brought at various
stages to a standstill, and such a change in his life-history
would have its own special results. One of the
most momentous of these results is the fossilisation of
social and mental conditions. Man stationary, or
movable by custom within restricted areas, would live
under conditions which must have produced forms of
culture different from those under which man lived
when he was always able to penetrate, not by custom
but by the force of circumstances, into the unknown
domain of unoccupied territory; and the fossilisation
of his culture at various stages of development, in
accord with the various periods of his being brought
to a standstill, would be the most important result.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
Whenever man was compelled to move onward the social
forces which were demanded of him, as he proceeded
from point to point, must have been quite different from
those which he could have adopted if he had been allowed
to stay in areas which suited him, if he could have
selected his settlement grounds and awaited events.
The calmness of the latter methods would perhaps
have led to the unconscious development of social
forms; the roughness of the actual method of constant
movement led to the conscious adoption of social forms
which has altered man's history. These considerations
bring us to the conclusion that it is during the period
of migratory movement that man has developed the
social and religious elements with which the anthropologist
finds him endowed, when at last in modern
days he has been brought within the ken of scientific
observation, and that therefore it is as a migratory not
a stationary organism that the evolution of human
society has to be studied, aided by the fact that enforced
stationary conditions have produced in the savage world
examples of perhaps the most remote as well as the
more recent types of primitive humanity.</p>

<p>This last possibility, however, is not admitted by
the best authorities. They endeavour to use biological
methods in order to get behind existing savagery for
the earliest period of human savagery. Darwin is not
satisfied with the evidence as to promiscuity, strong
as it appeared to him to be, and he pronounced it to
be "extremely improbable" in a state of nature, and
falls back upon the evidence of the rudimentary stages
of human existence, there being, as among the gorillas,
but one adult male in the band, and "when the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
male grows up, a contest takes place for the mastery,
and the strongest, by killing and driving out the others,
establishes himself as the head of the community."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Mr. McLennan nowhere states the evidence for his first
stage of human society&mdash;the primitive horde without
any ideas of kinship, and based upon a fellowship of
common interests and dangers<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>&mdash;but arrives at it by
argument deduced from the conditions of later stages
of development, and from the necessary suppositions
as to the pre-existing stage which must have led to the
later. Mr. Westermarck leads us straight to the evidence
of the lower animals, from which he arrives at
the small groups of humans headed by the male, and
provides us with the theory of a human pairing
season.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Mr. Morgan claims that no exemplification
of mankind in his assumed lower status of savagery
remained to the historical period,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> presumably meaning
the anthropo-historical period. And finally, Mr. Lang
definitely claims that conjecture, and conjecture alone,
remains as the means of getting back to the earliest
human origins.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>There is great danger in relying too closely upon
conjecture. We shall be repeating in anthropology
what the analytical jurists accomplished in law and
jurisprudence, and it will then soon become necessary
to do for anthropology what Sir Henry Maine did for
comparative jurisprudence, namely, demonstrate that
the analytical method does not take us back to human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
origins, but to highly developed systems of society.
Law, in the hands of the analytical jurists, is merely
one part of the machinery of modern government.
Social beginnings in the hands of conjectural anthropologists
are merely abstractions with the whole history
of man put on one side. Mr. Lang in leading the way
towards the analytical method in anthropology has
avoided many of its pitfalls, but his disciples are not
so successful. Thus, when Mr. Thomas declares that
"custom which has among them [primitive peoples]
far more power than law among us, determines whether
a man is of kin to his mother and her relatives alone,
or to his father and father's relatives, or whether both
sets of relatives are alike of kin to them,"<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> he is neglecting
the whole significance and range of custom.
His statement is true analytically, but it is not true
anthropologically until we have ascertained what this
custom to which he refers really is, whence it is derived,
how it has obtained its force, what is its range
of action, how it operates in differentiating among the
various groups of mankind&mdash;in a word, what is the
human history associated with this custom.</p>

<p>We must, however, at certain points in anthropological
inquiry have recourse to the conjectural
method. Its value lies in the fact that it states, and
states clearly, the issue which is before us, and it is
always possible to take up the conjectural position
and endeavour to ascertain whether the neglected
facts of human history which it expresses can be
recovered. Its danger lies in the neglect of certain
anthropological principles which can only be noted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
from definite examples, and the significance of which
can only be discovered by the handling of definite
examples. I will refer to one or two of the principles
which I have in mind. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish
between what is a practice and what is a rule.
A practice precedes a rule. A practice incidental to
one stage of society must not be confused with a rule,
similar to the practice, obtaining in a different stage of
society. Again, it must be borne in mind that identity
of practice is no certain evidence of parallel stages of
culture, and already it has been pointed out that identical
practices do not always come from the same
causes. Thirdly, it has to be borne in mind that
primitive peoples specialise in certain directions to an
extreme extent, and correspondingly cause neglect in
other directions. The normal, therefore, has to give
way to the special, and it is the degree of specialisation
and the degree of neglect which are measuring
factors of progress; in other words, it is the conscious
adoption of certain rules of life with which we alone
have to do.</p>

<p>These principles are apt to be wholly neglected, and,
indeed, the last-mentioned element in the evolution of
human society does not enter into the calculations of
analytical anthropologists. They provide for the normal
according to scientific ideas of what the normal is.
They either neglect or openly reject what cannot be
called abnormal, because it appears everywhere, but
which they are inclined to treat as abnormal because it
does not fit into their accepted lines of development.
That which I have ventured to term specialisation and
neglect is a great and important feature in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
anthropology. It obtains everywhere in more or less degree,
and accounts for some of the apparently unaccountable
facts in savage society, where we are frequently encountered
by a comparatively high degree of culture
associated with a cruel and debasing system of rites
and practices which belong to the lowest savagery.
Dr. Haddon has usefully suggested the term "differential
evolution" for this phenomenon in the culture
history of man,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> and as I find myself in entire agreement
with this distinguished anthropologist as to the
facts<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> which call for a special terminology, I gladly
adopt his valuable suggestion.</p>

<p>It is advisable to explain this phenomenon by
reference to examples, and I will take the point of
specialisation first. Even where industrial arts have
advanced far beyond the primitive stage we are considering,
we have the case of the Ahts, with whom
"though living only a few miles apart, the tribes
practise different arts and have apparently distinct
tribal characteristics. One tribe is skilful in shaping
canoes, another in painting boards for ornamental
work, or making ornaments for the person, or instruments
for hunting and fishing. Individuals as a rule
keep to the arts for which their tribe has some repute,
and do not care to acquire those arts in which other
tribes excel. There seems to be among all the tribes
in the island a sort of recognised tribal monopoly in
certain articles produced, or that have been long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
manufactured in their own district. For instance, a
tribe that does not grow potatoes, or make a particular
kind of mat, will go a long way year after
year to barter for those articles, which if they liked they
themselves could easily produce or manufacture."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
The remarkable case of the Todas specialising in
cattle rearing and dairy farming is another example.
Other people, both higher and lower in civilisation
than the Todas, keep cattle and know the value of
milk, but it is reserved for the Todas alone to have
used this particular economic basis of their existence
as the basis also of their social formation and their
religious life.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The result is that they neglect other
forms of social existence. They are not totemists,
though perhaps they have the undeveloped germs of
totemistic beliefs.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Their classificatory system of relationship
makes their actual kinship scarcely recognisable;
they "have very definite restrictions on the
freedom of individuals to marry," and have a two-class
endogamous division, but their marriage rite is
merely the selection of nominal fathers for their
children.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Throughout the careful study which we
now possess, thanks to Dr. Rivers, of this people,
there is the dominant note of dairy economy superimposing
itself upon all else, and even religion seems
to be in a state of decadence.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> I do not know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
anywhere else could be found a stronger example of the
results of extreme specialisation upon the social and
mental condition of a people. As a rule such specialisation
does not extend to a whole people, but rather
to sections, as, for instance, among the Gold Coast
tribes of Africa who "transmit the secret of their
skill from father to son and keep the corporation to
which they belong up to a due degree of closeness by
avoiding intermarriage with any of the more unskilled
labourers,"<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> and Dr. Bucher, who has worked
out many of the earliest conditions of primitive
economics, concludes that it may be safely claimed
that every "tribe displays some favourite form of
industrial activity in which its members surpass the
other tribes."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This rule extends to the lowest type
of man, as, for instance, among the Australians. Each
tribe of the Narrinyeri, says Taplin, have been
accustomed to make those articles which their tract
of country enabled them to produce most easily; one
tribe will make weapons, another mats, and a third
nets, and then they barter them one with another.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The evidence for industrial evolution is full of cases
such as these, and they are extremely important to
note, because it is not the mere existence of particular
customs or particular beliefs among different peoples
which is the factor to take into account, but the use or
non-use, and the extent of the use or non-use, to
which the particular customs or beliefs are put in each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
case.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Let me turn from the phenomenon of over-specialisation
to that of neglect, and for this purpose I
will take the simple fact of blood kinship. Existing
obviously everywhere through the mother, and not
obviously but admittedly through the father among
most primitive peoples, there are examples where both
maternal kinship and paternal kinship are neglected
factors in the construction of the social group. The
Nahals of Khandesh, for instance, neglect kinship
altogether, and exist perfectly wild among the mountains,
subsisting chiefly on roots, fruits, and berries,
though the children during infancy accompany the
mother in her unattached freedom from male control,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
just as Herodotos describes the condition of the
Auseans "before the Hellenes were settled near
them."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Similarly, among many primitive peoples,
kinship with the mother is recognised while kinship
with the father is purposely neglected as a social
factor. Thus, among the Khasia Hill people, the
husband visits his wife occasionally in her own home,
where "he seems merely entertained to continue the
family to which his wife belongs."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> This statement,
so peculiarly appropriate to my purpose, is not merely
an accident of language. With the people allied to
the Khasis, namely, the Syntengs and the people of
Maoshai, "the husband does not go and live in his
mother-in-law's house; he only visits her there. In
Jowai, the husband came to his mother-in-law's house
only after dark," and the explanation of the latest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
authority is that among these people "the man is
nobody ... if he be a husband he is looked upon
merely as <i>u shong kha</i>, a begetter."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>The neglect of maternal and paternal kinship respectively
in these two cases is obvious. They are recognised
physically. But they are not used as part of the
fabric of social institutions. Physical motherhood or
fatherhood is nothing to these people, and one must
learn to understand that there is wide difference between
the mere physical fact of having a mother and
father, and the political fact of using this kinship for
social organisation. Savages who have not learnt the
political significance have but the scantiest appreciation
of the physical fact. The Australians, for instance,
have no term to express the relationship between
mother and child. This is because the physical fact is
of no significance, and not as Mr. Thomas thinks because
of the meagreness of the language.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Our field
anthropologists do not quite understand the savage in
this respect. It is of no use preparing a genealogical
tree on the basis of civilised knowledge of genealogy
if such a document is beyond the ken of the people to
whom it relates. The information for it may be
correctly collected, but if the whole structure is not
within the compass of savage thought it is a misleading
anthropological document. It is of no use translating
a native term as "father," if father did not mean
to the savage what it means to us. It might mean
something so very different. With us, fatherhood
connotes a definite individual with all sorts of social,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
economical, and political associations, but what does it
mean to the savage? It may mean physical fatherhood
and nothing more, and physical fatherhood may be a
fact of the veriest insignificance. It may mean social
fatherhood, where all men of a certain status are fathers
to all children of the complementary status, and social
fatherhood thus becomes much more than we can understand
by the term father.</p>

<p>We cannot ignore the evidence which over-specialisation
in one direction and neglect in other directions
supply to anthropology. It shows us that human
societies cannot always be measured in the scale of
culture by the most apparent of the social elements
contained in them. The cannibalism of the Fijians,
the art products of the Maori, the totemism of the
Australian blacks, do not express all that makes up the
culture of these people, although it too often happens
that they are made to do duty for the several estimates
of culture progress. It follows that a survey of the
different human societies might reveal examples of the
possible lowest in the scale as well as various advances
from the lowest; or in lieu of whole societies in the
lowest scale, there might be revealed unexceptional
examples of the possible lowest elements of culture
within societies not wholly in the lowest scale. It will
be seen how valuable an asset this must be in anthropological
research. It justifies those who assert that existing
savagery or existing survival will supply evidence
of man at the very earliest stages of existence. It is the
root idea of Dr. Tylor's method of research, and it is an
essential feature in the science of folklore.</p>

<p>Evidence of this nature, however, needs to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
exhaustively collected, and to be subjected to the most
careful examination, as otherwise it may be used for
the merest <i>a priori</i> argument of the most mischievous
and inconclusive description. It involves consideration
of whole human groups rather than of particular sections
of each human group, of the whole corpus of
social, religious, and economical elements residing in
each human group rather than of the separated items.
Each human group, having its specialised and dormant
elements, must be treated as an organism and not as
a bundle of separable items, each one of which the
student may use or let alone as he desires. That
which is anthropological evidence is the indivisible
organism, and whenever, for convenience of treatment
and considerations of space, particular elements only
are used in evidence, they must be qualified, and the
use to which they are provisionally put for scientific
purposes must be checked, by the associated elements
with which the particular elements are connected.</p>

<p>The human groups thus called upon to surrender
their contributions to the history of man are of
various formations, and consist of various kinds
of social units. There is no one term which can
properly be applied to all, and it will have been noted
that I have carefully avoided giving the human groups
hitherto dealt with any particular name, and only
under protest have I admitted the terms used by
the authorities I have quoted. I think the term
"tribe" is not applicable to savage society, for it
is used to denote peoples in all degrees of social
evolution, and merely stands for the group which is
known by a given name, or roams over a given district.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
But the use of this term is not so productive of harm
as the use of the term "family," because of the
universal application of this term to the smallest social
unit of the civilised world, and because of the fundamental
difference of structure of the units which
roughly answer to the definition of family in various
parts of the world. It is no use in scientific matters to
use terms of inexact reference. As much as almost
anything else it has led to false conclusions as to the
evolution of the family, conclusions which seem to
entangle even the best authorities in a mass of contradictions.
I cannot think of a family group in savagery
with father, mother, sons, and daughters, all delightfully
known to each other, in terms which also belong
to the civilised family, and still less can I think of these
terms being used to take in the extended grouping of
local kinships. One of our greatest difficulties, indeed,
is the indiscriminate use of kinship terms by our descriptive
authorities. We are never quite sure whether the
physical relationships included in them convey anything
whatever to the savage. If he knows of the physical
fact, he does not use it politically, for blood kinship as
a political force is late, not early, and the early tie was
dependent upon quite other circumstances. Over and
over again it will be found stated by established
authorities that the family was the primal unit, the
grouped families forming the larger clan, the grouped
clans forming the larger tribe. This is Sir Henry
Maine's famous formula, and it is the basis of his
investigation into early law and custom.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> It is founded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
upon the false conception of the family in early history,
and upon a too narrow interpretation of the stages of
evolution. When we are dealing with savage society,
the terms family and tribe do not connote the same
institution as when we are dealing with higher forms
of civilisation. There is something roughly corresponding
to these groupings in both systems, but they
do not actually equate. When we pass to the Semitic
and the Aryan-speaking peoples, both the family and
tribe have assumed a definite place in the polity of the
races which is not to be found outside these peoples.</p>

<p>So strongly has the family impressed itself upon the
thought of the age that students of man in his earliest
ages are found stating that "the family is the most
ancient and the most sacred of human institutions."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
This proposition, however, is not only denied by other
authorities, as, for instance, Mr. Jevons, who affirms
that "the family is a comparatively late institution in
the history of society,"<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> but it rests upon the merely
analytical basis of research, separated entirely from those
facts of man's history which are discoverable by the
means just now suggested. One is, of course, quite
prepared to find the family among civilisations older
than the Indo-European, and yet to find that it is a
comparatively late institution among Indo-European
peoples. As a matter of fact, this is the case; for the
two kinds of family, the family as seen in savage society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
and the family as it appears among the antiquities of
the Indo-European people, are totally distinct in origin,
in compass, and in force; while welded between the two
kinds of family is the whole institution of the tribe.
It is no use introducing the theory adopted by Grote,
Niebuhr, Mommsen, Thirlwall, Maine, and other authorities
who have studied the legal antiquities of
classical times, that the tribe is the aggregate of original
family units. Later on I shall show that this cannot be
the case. The larger kinship of the tribe is a primary
unit of ancient society, which thrusts itself between the
savage family and the civilised family, showing that the
two types are separated by a long period of history
during which the family did not exist.</p>

<p>It has taken me some time to explain these points in
anthropological science, which appear to me not to have
received proper consideration at the hands of the
masters of the science, but which are essential factors
in the history of man and are necessary to a due consideration
of the position occupied by folklore. The
chief results obtained are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Migratory man would deposit his most rudimentary
social type not at the point of starting his
migration, but at the furthest point therefrom.</p>

<p>(2) Custom due to the migratory period would continue
after real migratory movement had ceased,
and from this body of custom would be derived
all later forms of social custom.</p>

<p>(3) Non-kinship groups are more rudimentary than
kinship groups, and are still observable in
savage anthropology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
(4) Anthropological evidence must be based upon the
whole of the characteristics of human groups,
not upon special characteristics singled out for
the purpose of research.</p></div>

<p>It is with these results we have to work. They
will help us to see how far the facts of anthropology,
which begin far behind the historical world, have to do
with the problems presented by folklore as a science
having to deal with the historical world.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>We may now inquire where anthropology and folklore
meet. It is significant in this connection that in order to
reach back to the earliest ages of man, our first appeal
seems to be to folklore. The appeal at present does not
lead us far perhaps, but it certainly acts as a finger post
in the inquiry, for Dr. Kollmann, rejecting the evidence
of the Java <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> as the earliest
pal&aelig;ontological evidence of man, advances the opinion
that the direct antecedents of man should not be sought
among the species of anthropoid apes of great height
and with flat skulls, but much further back in the
zoological scale, in the small monkeys with pointed
skulls; from which, he believes, were developed the
human pygmy races of prehistoric ages with pointed
skulls, and from these pygmy races finally developed
the human race of historic times. And he relies upon
folklore for one part of his evidence, for it is this descent
of man, he thinks, which explains the persistency with
which mythology and folklore allude to the subject of
pygmy people, as well as the relative frequency with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
which recently the fossils of small human beings
belonging to prehistoric times have been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
It must not be forgotten, too, that this remote period
is found in another class of tradition, namely, that to
which Dr. Tylor refers as containing the memory of
the huge animals of the quaternary period.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>It must be confessed that we do not get far with this
evidence alone. If it proves that the true starting point
is to be found in folklore, it also proves that folklore
alone is not capable of working through the problem.
Anthropology must aid here, and I will suggest the
lines on which it appears to me it does this.</p>

<p>Our first effort must be made by the evidence suggested
by the conjectural method. This leads us to
small human groups, each headed by a male who drives
out all other males and himself remains with his females
and his children. Sexual selection thus acts with primitive
economics<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> in keeping the earliest groups small in
numbers, and creating a spreading out from these
groups of the males cast out. We have male supremacy
in its crudest form accompanied by an enforced male
celibacy, so far as the group in which the males are
born is concerned, on the part of those who survive
the struggle for supremacy and wander forth on their
own account. Marking the stages from point to point,
in order to arrive at a systematic method of stating the
complex problem presented by the subject we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg&nbsp;240]</a></span>
investigating, we can project from this earliest condition
of man's life two important elements of social evolution,
namely&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) Younger men are celibate within the natural groups
of human society, or are driven out therefrom.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Men thus driven out will seek mates on their own
account, and will secure them partly from the
original group as far as they are permitted or
are successful in their attempts, and partly by
capture from other local groups.</p></div>

<p>The first of these elements strongly emphasises the
migratory character of the earliest human groups. The
second shows how each group is relieved of the incubus
of too great a number for the economic conditions by
the double process of sending forth its young males, and
of its younger females being captured by successful
marauders.</p>

<p>Let us take a fuller note of what the conditions of
such a life might be. There is no tie of kinship
operating as a social force within the groups; there is
the unquestioned condition of hostility surrounding
each group, and there is the enforced practice of providing
mates by capture. Of these three conditions the
most significant is undoubtedly the absence of the
kinship tie. If then we use this as the basis for grouping
the earliest examples of social organisation, we
proceed to inquire whether there are any examples of
kinless society in anthropological evidence.</p>

<p>Following up the clue supplied by folklore, we may
see whether the pygmy people of anthropological observation
answer in any way to those conjectural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
conditions.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> I think they do. Thus, we find that the
pygmy people are in all cases on the extreme confines
of the world's occupation ground; that they occupy
the territory to which they have been pushed, not that
which they have chosen. As the most primitive representatives,
they are the last outposts of the migratory
movements. Dr. Beke has preserved an account of
the pygmies which even in its terminology assists in
their identification as a type of the remotest stages of
social existence. Dr. Beke obtained certain information
about the countries south-west of Abyssinia, from
which Latham quotes the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The people of Doko, both men and women, are said to
be no taller than boys nine or ten years old. They never
exceed that height even in the most advanced age. They go
quite naked; their principal foods are ants, snakes, mice, and
other things which commonly are not used as food....
They also climb trees with great skill to fetch down the
fruits, and in doing this they stretch their hands downwards
and their legs upwards.... They live mixed together;
men and women unite and separate as they please.... The
mother suckles the child only as long as she is unable to find
ants and snakes for its food; she abandons it as soon as it
can get its food by itself. No rank or order exists among
the Dokos. Nobody orders, nobody obeys, nobody defends
the country, nobody cares for the welfare of the nation."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
This evidence is confirmed in many directions. It
coincides with the account by Herodotos of the expedition
from Libya which met with a pygmy race,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> and with
a seventeenth-century account of a Dutch expedition to
the north from the south, who "found a tribe of people
very low in stature and very lean, entirely savage, without
huts, cattle, or anything in the world except their
lands and wild game."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Captain Burrows' account of
the Congoland pygmies agrees in all essentials, and
he particularly notes that they "have no ties of family
affection such as those of mother to son or sister to
brother, and seem to be wanting in all social qualities;"
they have no religion and no fetich rites; no burial
ceremony and no mourning for the dead; in short, he
adds, "they are to my thinking the closest link with
the original Darwinian anthropoid ape extant."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The
evidence of the African pygmy people everywhere confirms
these views, and differences of detail do not alter
the general results.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

Asia.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The Semang people of the Malay Peninsula
are a short race, the male being four feet nine inches
in height, with woolly and tufted hair, thick lips and
flat nose, and their language is connected with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>group of which the Khasi people is a member.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> They
subsist upon the birds and beasts of the forest, and
roots, eating elephants, rhinoceros, monkeys, and rats.
They are said to have chiefs among them, but all
property is common. Their huts or temporary dwellings,
for they have no fixed habitations but rove
about like the beasts of the forest, consist of two posts
stuck in the ground with a small cross-piece and a few
leaves or branches of trees laid over to secure them
from the weather, and their clothing consists chiefly of
the inner bark of trees.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> They use stone or slate
implements. The authority for this information does
not directly state their social formation, but in a footnote
he compares them to the Negritos of the Philippine
Islands, "who are divided into very small societies very
little connected with each other." This is confirmed
by Mr. Hugh Clifford, who relates a story told to him
in the camp of the Semangs, which tells how these
people were driven to their present resting-place, "not
for love of these poor hunting grounds," but because
they were thrust there by the Malays who stole their
women. One further point is interesting; they have
a legend of a people in their old home, composed of
women only. "These women know not men, but
but when the moon is at the full, they dance naked in
the grassy places near the salt-licks; the evening wind
is their only spouse, and through him they conceive
and bear children."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> All this has been confirmed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
more than confirmed by the important researches of
Messrs. Skeat and Blagden in their recently published
work on these people. There is no necessity to do
more than refer to the principal features brought out
by these authorities. In the valuable notes on environment,

<p>I shall not attempt to exhaust the evidence to be
derived from the pygmy people. What has been said
of the examples I have chosen may in all essentials be
said of the remaining examples. But it is perhaps
advisable to be assured that the evidence of kinless
people is not confined to the stunted and dwarfed
races, for it has been argued that the pygmies are
nothing but the ne'er-do-wells of the stronger races,
and may not therefore be taken as true racial types.
This may be true, but it does not affect my case,
because I am not depending so much upon the
physical characteristics of these people as upon their
culture characteristics. These are definite and conclusive,
and they are repeated among people of higher
physical type. Thus the Jolas of the Gambia district
have practically no government and no law; every
man does as he chooses, and the most successful thief
is considered the greatest man. There is no recognised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
punishment for murder or any other crime. Individual
settlement is the only remedy, and the fittest
survives. There is no formality in regard to marriage,
or what passes for marriage, amongst them. Natural
selection is observed on both sides, and the pair, after
having ascertained a reciprocity of sentiment, at once
cohabit. They do not intermarry with any other
race.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>It is possible to proceed from this to other regions
of man's occupation ground. In America, the evidence
of the modern savage is preceded by most interesting
facts. If we compare Dr. Brinton's conclusions as to
the spread of the American Indians from the north to
the south, and as to the development of culture in the
favoured districts being of the same origin as the undeveloped
culture of the less favoured and of absolutely
sterile districts, with Mr. Curtin's altogether
independent conclusions as to the growth of the
American creation myth with its cycle of first people
peaceful and migratory, and its cycle of second people
"containing accounts of conflicts which are ever recurrent,"
we are conscious that mythic and material
remains of great movements of people are in absolute
accord,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> an accord which leads us to expect
that the peoples who were pushed ever forward
into the most desolate and most sterile districts of
southern America would be the most nearly savage of
all the American peoples. This is in agreement with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
Darwin's estimate of the Fuegians who wander about
in groups of kinless society,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and it is in accord with
other evidence. Thus the Zaparos, belonging to the
great division of unchristianised Indians of the oriental
province of Ecuador, have the fame of being most
expert woodsmen and hunters. To communicate with
one another in the wood, they generally imitate the
whistle of the toman or partridge. They believe that
they partake of the nature of the animals they devour.
They are very disunited, and wander about in separate
hordes. The stealing of women is much carried on
even amongst themselves. A man runs away with
his neighbour's wife or one of them, and secretes himself
in some out of the way spot until he gathers
information that she is replaced, when he can again
make his appearance, finding the whole difficulty
smoothed over. In their matrimonial relations they
are very loose&mdash;monogamy, polygamy, communism,
and promiscuity all apparently existing amongst them.
They allow the women great liberty and frequently
change their mates or simply discard them when they
are perhaps taken up by another. They believe in a
devil or evil spirit which haunts the woods, and call
him Zam&aacute;ro.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>In all these cases, and I do not, of course, exhaust
the evidence, there is enough to suggest that the social
forms presented are of the most rudimentary kind.
Conjecture has not and, I think, cannot get further
back than such evidence as this. The social grouping
is supported by outside influences rather than internal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
organisation; neither blood kinship nor marital kinship
is recognised; hostility to all other groups and from
other groups is the basis of inter-groupal life. To
these significant characteristics has to be added the
special birth custom and belief of the Semang pygmies.
It is clear that the soul-bird belief and the tree-naming
custom are different phases of one conception of social
life, a conception definitely excluding recognition of
blood kinship, and derived from the conscious adoption
of an experience which has not reached the stage
of blood kinship, but which includes a close association
with natural objects. All this makes it advisable
to take fuller count of pygmy culture than has hitherto
been given to it. The pygmies have in truth always
been a problem in man's history. From the time
of Homer, Herodotos, and Aristotle, the pygmies
have had their place among the observable types of
man, or among the traditions to which observers have
given credence. In modern times they have been
accounted for either as peoples degraded from a higher
level of culture, or as peoples who have never advanced.
But whether we look upon these people as the last remnants
of the primitive condition of hostility or whether
they are reversions to that condition by reason of like
causes, they bring before us what conjectural research
has prepared us for. The first supposition is neither
impossible nor incredible. The slow spreading-out in
hostile regions would allow of the preservation of some
examples of preference for unrestrained licence at the
expense of constant hostility, in place of a modified
peacefulness at the expense of restricted freedom in
matters so dear to the human animal as sexual choice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
and power. The second supposition contains an element
of human history which must find a place in anthropological
research. The possible phases of social
formation are very limited. If any section of mankind
cannot develop in one direction, they will stagnate at
the stage they have reached, or they will retrograde to
one of the stages from which in times past they have
proceeded. There is no other course, and the very
limitations of primitive life prevent us from considering
the possibility of any other course. Either of these
alternatives allows us to consider the examples of hostile
inter-grouping as sufficient to supply us with the vantage
ground for observation of man in his earliest
stages of existence. Perhaps each of them may contain
somewhat of the truth. But whatever may be considered
as the true cause of the pygmy level of culture, there
is an underlying factor which must count most strongly
in its determination, namely, that these people are the
people who in the process of migration have been pushed
out to the last strongholds of man. Whether they could
not or would not conform to the newer condition of
stationary or comparatively stationary society is not
much to the point in presence of the fact that nowhere
have they conformed to this standard of existence. Moreover
we are entitled to the argument, which has been
the main point advanced in connection with the anthropological
problems we are discussing, that the most
primitive type of man must of necessity be sought for,
and can only be found at the extremes of the migration
movement wherever that is discernible.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>The question now becomes, can we by means of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
recognisable links proceed from the rudimentary kinless
stage of society to the earliest stage of kinship
society? This is a most difficult problem, but it must be
solved. If the rudimentary kinless groups do indeed
constitute a factor in human evolution, they are a most
important factor. If they do not constitute such a factor,
they can only be accidental productions, the sport of exceptional
circumstances not in the line of evolution, and
as such they are not of much use in anthropology. It will
be seen, therefore, that the connection between rudimentary
kinless society and the earliest, or representatives
of the earliest, kinship society, is an essential part
of an inquiry into origins.</p>

<p>It may be approached first from the conjectural basis.
On this basis it may be asserted that the victorious
male of the primary groups would remain victorious
only just so long as he could continue to adjust the
conditions on the primary basis, and preserve his
females to himself. New conditions would arise whenever
the limitation of the food lands produced a degree
of localisation of the hitherto movable groups. There
would then have crept into human experience the
necessity for something of common action among a
wider range than the simple group. This is a new
force, and social evolution is henceforth going to
operate in addition to, perhaps to a limited extent in
substitution of, the constant movement towards new
food lands. The single male would no longer be the
victorious male by himself; and sharing his power
with other males meant the reduction of his power in
his own group. Called away for something more than
the defence of his own primary group of females, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
would leave the females with the practical governance
of the primary groups. This tendency would develop.
Wherever the constant movement outwards became
stayed by geographical or other influences, the groups
which experienced the shock of stoppage would undergo
change. The female in the various primary groups
would become a static element, and the male alone
would follow out in the more restricted area the older
force of movement which he had learned during the
period of unrestricted scope.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> He would have to find
his mates during his roamings, instead of the former
condition of fighting for them during the group movements;
and his relationship to the primary groups
would be therefore fundamentally changed. From
being the central dominant head, he would become
a constantly shifting unit. The female under these
conditions would become the centre of the new social
unit, and the male would become the hunter for food
and the fighter against enemies. The new social forces
would thus consist of local units commanded by the
female, and revolving units composed of the males,
and there would arise therefrom cleavage between the
economic conditions of the two sexes.</p>

<p>That primitive economics bear the impress of sex
cleavage is borne out by every class of evidence, and
it is in this circumstance that we first come upon
societies distinguished by containing two of the most
important social elements, exogamy and totemism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
Before, however, examining examples of societies containing
the two elements of exogamy and totemism, it will
be necessary to say something by way of preliminaries
on these two elements themselves. They have rightly
been made the subject of important special inquiry by
anthropological scholars, as being in fact the key to the
question of social evolution, and we shall clear the
ground considerably by first of all turning to the principal
authorities on the subject, and ascertaining the
present position of the inquiry.</p>

<p>I must however note, in the first place, that as I have
stated the case, exogamy and totemism appear as two
separate and distinct elements, whereas it is usual to
consider exogamy as an essential part of totemism.
I cannot, however, see that this is so. In advanced
totemism, it is true, they are found as inseparable
parts of one system, but they may well have started
separately and coalesced later. In point of fact, all the
evidence points in this direction, and if we cease to
consider exogamy as a necessary element of totemism,
we can advance investigation more rapidly and with
greater accuracy.</p>

<p>We come very quickly upon what may be termed
natural exogamy. Male working with male outside the
groups formed by women and the younger offspring
would produce a natural exogamy, which would have
followed upon the exogamy produced by hostile capture
of women, and two streams of influence would
thus tell in favour of the evolution of a system of
formal exogamy, and Dr. Westermarck's theory of a
natural avoidance of housemates, with all its wealth
of evidence, helps us at this point.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
The position is not so clear as to totemism. If we
begin, however, with a clear understanding that it is not
a part of the machinery of exogamous grouping, but
an independent growth of its own, we shall have
gained an important point, for the contrary opinion
has very often obscured the issue and prevented research
in the right direction.</p>

<p>It will be advisable to have before us the principal
theories as to the origin of totemism. There are practically
three&mdash;Mr. Frazer's, Mr. Lang's, and Mr. Baldwin
Spencer's. Mr. Frazer considers totemism to be "in
its essence nothing more or less than an early theory of
conception, which presented itself to savage man at a
time when he was still ignorant of the true cause of
the propagation of the species." Mr. Frazer explains
this theory further by saying that "naturally enough,
when she is first aware of the mysterious movement
within her, the mother fancies that something has that
very moment passed into her body, and it is equally
natural that in her attempt to ascertain what the thing
is, she should fix upon some object that happened to
be near her, or to engage her attention at the critical
moment."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Lang rejects Mr. Frazer's theory <i>in toto</i>, and
propounds his own as due to the naming of savage
societies, and to a sort of natural exogamy produced by
practically the same set of conditions as I have already
described. Mr. Lang's totemism began in the primary
groups, and began with exogamy as a necessary part
of it. "Unessential to my system," says Mr. Lang,
"is the question how the groups got animal names, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
long as they got them, and did not remember how they
got them, and as long as the names according to their
way of thinking indicated an essential and mystic
rapport between each group and its name-giving
animal. No more than these three things&mdash;a group
animal name of unknown origin; belief in a transcendental
connection between all bearers human and
bestial of the same name; and belief in the blood
superstitions (the mystically sacred quality of the
blood as life)&mdash;was needed to give rise to all the totemic
creeds and practices including exogamy," and further,
"we guess that for the sake of distinction, groups
gave each other animal and plant names. These became
stereotyped we conjecture, and their origin was
forgotten. The belief that there must necessarily be
some connection between animals and men of the
same names led to speculation about the nature of the
connection. The usual reply to the question was that the
men and animals of the same name were akin by blood.
The kinship <i>with animals</i> being particularly mysterious
was peculiarly sacred. From these ideas arose tabus,
and among others that of totemic exogamy."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin Spencer, and with him Dr. Haddon,
consider totemism to have arisen from economic
conditions. Primitive human groups, says Dr. Haddon,
"could never have been large, and the individuals
comprising each group must have been closely related.
In favourable areas each group would have a tendency
to occupy a restricted range, owing to the disagreeable
results which arose from encroaching on the territory
over which another group wandered. Thus, it would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
inevitably come about that a certain animal or plant, or
group of animals or plants, would be more abundant in
the territory of one group than in that of another."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>These theories are not necessarily mutually destructive,
though they seem to me even collectively not to contain
the full case for totemism. Mr. Frazer does not
account for woman's isolation at the time of conceptual
quickening, for the closeness of her observation of local
phenomena, and for the separateness of her ideas from
the actual facts of procreation. Mr. Lang overloads his
case. He is accounting not for the origin of totemism,
but for the origin of all, or almost all, that totemism
contains in its most developed forms&mdash;"all the totemic
creeds and practices including exogamy" as he says.
He postulates a name-giving process by drawing upon
the conceptions as to names by advanced savage thought,
and he does not account for the fact that according to his
theory, animals and plants must not only have been
named, but named upon some sort of system known to
a wide area of peoples, before totemistic names for the
groups could have been given to them. Mr. Spencer's
and Dr. Haddon's theory is perhaps open to the doubts
caused by Mr. Lang's criticism of it that there is only
one case of a known economic cause for totemism&mdash;an
Australian case where two totem kins are said to have
been so called "from having in former times principally
subsisted on a small fish and a very small opossum;"<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
but on the other hand it does supply a <i>vera causa</i>, the
actual evidence for which may well have passed away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
with the development of totemism, without leaving
survivals.</p>

<p>All these theories, however, are the result of considerable
research and experience, and it is more than
probable that they may each contain fragments of the
truth which need the touch of combination to show how
they stand in relation to the problem which they are
propounded to solve. There are features of totemism
which are not noticed by any of these distinguished
authorities. By using the hitherto unnoticed features,
I think it possible to produce a theory as to the origin
of totemism, which will contain the essential features of
those theories now prominently before the world.</p>

<p>I will set down the order in which the problem can
be approached from the standpoint already reached,
and we may afterwards try to ascertain what proof is
to be derived from totemic societies of the rudest type.</p>

<p>Now totemism is essentially a system of social grouping,
whose chief characteristic is that it is kinless&mdash;that
is to say, the tie of totemism is not the tie of blood
kinship, but the artificially created association with
natural objects or animals. It takes no count of fatherhood,
and only reckons with the physical fact of motherhood.
It is not the actual fatherhood or the actual
motherhood which is the fundamental basis of totemism,
but the association with animal, plant, or other
natural object. This is evidently the fact, whatever
view is taken of totemism, and that totemism is, in its
origin and principle, a kinless, not a kinship system,
is the first fact of importance to bear in mind throughout
all inquiry. Thus Messrs. Spencer and Gillen say
"the identity of the human individual is often sunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
in that of the animal or plant from which he is supposed
to have originated."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>The next fact of importance is that as it commences at
birth time, it must be closely associated with the mother
and her actions as mother. This leads us to the
observation that it is through the agency of the mother
that the totem name is conferred upon their children, and
to the necessary antecedent fact that women must have
themselves possessed the name they conferred&mdash;possessed,
that is, either the name as a personal attribute
and valued as such, or else the power of evolving the
name and the capacity of using it with totemic significance.
I conclude from this, therefore, that the search
for the origin of totemism must be made from the
women's side of the social group. Such a search
would lead straight to the industrialism of early woman,
from which originated the domestication of animals,
the cultivation of fruits and cereals, and the appropriation
of such trees and shrubs as were necessary to
primitive economics.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The close and intimate relationship
with human life which such animals, plants, and
trees would assume under the social conditions which
have been postulated as belonging to this earliest stage
of evolution, and the aid which these friendly and
always present companions would render at all times
and under most circumstances, would generate and develop
many of those savage conceptions which have
become known to research. As human friends they
would become part of humanity, just as Livingstone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
notes of an African people that they did not eat the
beef which he offered to them because "they looked
upon cattle as human and living at home like men,"<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
an idea which is also the basis of the custom in India
not to taste fruit of a newly planted mangrove tree
until it is formally "married" to some other tree.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
These are but the fortunate instances where definite
record in set terms has been made. At the back of
them lies a whole collection of anthropomorphic conceptions,
indulged in by man at all stages of his career.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
As superhuman agencies for pregnancy and birth, they
would do what the human father in the society we are
contemplating could not be expected to do, for he
would be seldom present during the long period of
pregnancy; he would have shared with other males
the privileges of sexual intercourse, and he would
therefore not be so closely in companionship with the
women of the local groups as the friendly animal,
plant, or tree who did so much for the mothers. There
would thus be formed the groundwork for the fashioning
of that most incredible of all beliefs, well founded,
as Mr. Hartland has proved both from tradition and
belief,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> that the human father was not father, and that
other agencies were responsible for the birth of
children.</p>

<p>Gathering up the several threads of this argument, it
seems to me that there is within this sphere of primitive
thought and within these conditions of primitive life,
ample room for the growth of all the main conceptions
belonging to totemism; and it will be seen how necessary
it is to separate totemism at its beginning from
totemism in its most advanced stages. Totemism has
not come to man fully equipped in all its parts. It
is like every other human institution, the result of a
long process of development, and the various stages of
development are important parts of the evidence as to
origins. At the beginning, it was clearly not connected
with blood kinship and descent; it was as clearly not
connected with any class system of marriage. But its
beginnings would allow of these later growths, would
perhaps almost engender these later growths.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
Thus, the primary notion of the totem birth of
children would, when blood kinship and descent became
a consciously accepted element in social development,
easily slide into the belief of a totemic ancestor
and kinship with the totem; the protection and assistance
afforded by the totem to the women of the primary
groups who became the mothers of new generations,
would easily grow into a sort of worship of the totem;
the adoption of the totem name from the circumstances
of birth implying the origin of the name from within
the group and not from without would, as aggregation
took the place of segregation, give way before the
association of groups of persons with common interests;
the aggregate totem name would come to the separate
local totems as soon as, but not before, aggregation had
taken the place of segregation in the formation of the
social system, and this was not at the earliest stage; the
close association of the totems with groups of mothers
who always took the fathers of their children from
without the mother group, would readily develop into
differentiating the mother totems within the group
from the totems of the fathers without the group,
and this differentiation would produce a special relationship
between the sexes based upon the difference of
totems instead of upon the sameness of them; and
finally there would be produced first a two-class division
founded on sex&mdash;all the mothers and all the fathers&mdash;and,
only in a developed form, a two-class division
founded on the accepted totem name.</p>

<p>If this is a probable view of the course of totemic
evolution, we may more confidently refer to its final
stages for further evidence. Advanced totemic society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
shows a constant tendency to substitute blood kinship
for the association with natural objects: first, blood
kinship with the mother, then with the mother and the
father, finally recognised through the father only. At
this last stage, blood kinship has practically succeeded
in expelling totemic association altogether in favour of
tribal kinship by blood descent, for totemism with male
descent as the basis of the social group is totemism in
name only; the names of totemism remain but they are
applied to kinship tribes or sections of tribes, and they
do duty therefore as a convenient name-system without
reference to their origin in definite association with the
naming animal or plant; and it is already in position
to surrender also the names and outward signs. Blood
kinship is therefore the destroyer, not the generator, of
totemism, and we are therefore compelled to get at
the back of blood kinship if we want to find totem
beginnings.</p>

<p>This is an important aspect of the case, and it is one
which, I think, cannot be ignored. We have found
that rudimentary totemism was the basis of a social
system founded on artificial associations with animal or
plant, was therefore kinless in character; and we have
found that when totemism has been carried on into
a society developed upon the recognition of blood kinship,
blood kinship became antagonistic to totemism,
and ultimately displaced it. These two facts point to
the rudimentary kinless system as the true origin of
totemism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span></p>
<h4>III</h4>

<p>Now we may test these conclusions by applying the
theory they contain to an actual case of totemic society.
It would be well to choose for this purpose a people
who had specialised their totemic organisation, and
there are only two supreme instances of this among the
races of the world&mdash;the North American Indians and
the Australians. Everywhere else, where totemism
exists, it is not the dominant feature of the social
organisation. In Asia and in Africa totemism is subordinate
to, or at all events in close or equal association
with, other elements, and we cannot be quite sure
that we have in these cases pure totemism. North
American totemism is in the most advanced stage.
Australian totemism is to a very considerable degree
less advanced, and it is therefore to Australian totemism
I shall turn for evidence.</p>

<p>But even here it is necessary to bear in mind that
primitive as the Australians are, they are not so primitive
as to be in the primary stages of totemic society.
They have developed, and developed strongly along
totemic lines, and we know that such development
once started has the capacity to proceed far. What we
have to do, therefore, is to attempt to penetrate beneath
the range of development, to search for the social
group at the farthest from the centre point from which
migration started, to discover, if we can, relics of group
hostility, hostile capture of women and of kinless
society, all of which belong to the primary stage from
which totemic development has taken place. If we
can do this, we may hope to arrive at the origin of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
totemism, and we are more likely to accomplish it in
the case of the Australians than with any other people.
If we cannot, as Mr. Lang alleges, anywhere see
"absolutely primitive man and a totemic system in the
making,"<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> we may go back along the lines from which
totemism has developed in Australian society and see
somewhat of the process of the making.</p>

<p>We may commence with evidence of the survival of
the most primitive human trait, the condition of hostility
among the local groups produced by the struggle
for women. "The possession of a girl appears to
be connected with all their ideas of fighting ...
after a battle the girls do not always follow their
fugitive husbands from the field, but frequently go
over as a matter of course to the victors, even with
young children on their backs."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Mr. Curr puts the
evidence even more definitely in a primitive setting
when he informs us of "the young bachelors of the
tribe carrying off some of the girl wives of the grey-beards,"
leaving the old territory and settling at the
first convenient place within thirty or forty miles of the
old territory. I call this state of things "survival,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
because it is the existence in totemic society of the
fundamental basis of pre-totemic society. It is checked
in Australian totemic society by rules which show a
strong development from the primitive. Thus the
successful warrior may not take any of his captives
to himself; "if a warrior took to himself a captive who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
belonged to a forbidden class, he would be hunted
down like a wild beast," is the evidence of Mr. Fison,
who allows it to be "a strong statement, but it rests
upon strong evidence."<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> This is the exogamous class
system operating even in the case of conflict, when
men have resorted to their primitive instincts and their
primitive methods.</p>

<p>This discovery of primitive hostility accompanying the
obtaining of wives leads us to look for other survivals
of the earliest conditions, and we come upon mother-right
groups in which the females in each local group
are the sexual companions of males from outside their
own social group. This is shown by the Kamilaroi
organisation, where "a woman is married to a thousand
miles of husbands."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> This phrase may be textually an
exaggeration of actual fact, but it undoubtedly expresses
a condition of things which actually existed. Women
in Australian society must look outside their class, and
in general outside their totem, for their sexual mates, and
they must expect to be claimed as rightful sexual mates
by men whom they have never seen and who live at great
distances. Carry this state of things but a few steps
back, and we must come to a condition of localised
female groups with males moving from group to group.
Surely there is something more here than savage
organisation. The something more is the development
into a system of one of the results of the enforced
migratory conditions of early man, namely, the migratory
instincts of the males moving outside the
female local groups and thus producing natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span>
exogamy. This is what appears to me to be clearly a
distinct element in the Australian system. But there
is a new element in juxtaposition with it. The new
element is the organisation into marriage classes&mdash;not
every man from without, but only special men from
without, are allowed the sexual companionship.</p>

<p>Now in both these cases, where we have apparently
penetrated to the most primitive conditions, we are also
brought up abruptly against conditions which are not
primitive, namely, the exogamous class system, and
we are bound to conclude that this class system thus
shows itself to be an intruding force which has not,
however, been strong enough to quite obliterate the
older forces of hostile marriage-capture and mother-right
society.</p>

<p>Our next quest is therefore to find out, if we can, an
explanation of these two contrasted elements in Australian
totemic society, and for this purpose it is advisable
to still further narrow down the range of inquiry to one
special section of the Australian peoples. For this
purpose I shall take the Arunta. There has been much
controversy about this people. Mr. Lang argues that
the presence of exogamous classes and male descent
shows the Arunta to be more advanced than other
Australian peoples;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Messrs. Spencer and Gillen that
the survival of totem beliefs, which are local and unconnected
with the class system, proves them to be
the least advanced. In this country Mr. Hartland and
Mr. Thomas side with Mr. Lang; Mr. Frazer with
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen.</p>

<p>The first point of importance to note about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
Arunta people is that they occupy the least favourable
districts for food supply.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> This means that they have
been pushed there. They did not choose such a location&mdash;in
other words, they are among the last units of
the migration movements which peopled Australia; they
are among the last people to have become stationary as
a group, and to have been compelled to resort to the
development of social organisation in lieu of constantly
swarming off from the centre or from the last stopping
place to the ends. This tells for primitive, not advanced,
conditions.</p>

<p>The next point is the totem system. Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen, describing one special case as an example
of the rest, give us the following particulars. The
Arunta believe that the most marked features of the
district they inhabit, the gaps and the gorges, were
formed by their Alcheringa ancestors. These Alcheringa
are represented as collected together in companies,
each of which consisted of a certain number of individuals
belonging to one particular totem. Each of
these Alcheringa ancestors carried about with him or
her one or more of the sacred stones called churinga.
These are the general traditions related by the Arunta
of to-day to explain their own customs, and let it be
noted that the explanation does not necessarily lead us
to the primitive conceptions of the Arunta people, but
to their present conceptions as to unknown facts. The
local example is found close to Alice Springs, where
there are deposited a large number of churinga carried
by the witchetty grub men and women. A large
number of prominent rocks and boulders, and certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
ancient gum trees, are the nanja trees and rocks of
these spirits. If a woman conceives a child after having
been near to this gap, it is one of these spirit individuals
which has entered her body, and when born must of
necessity be of the witchetty grub totem; "it is, in
fact, nothing else but the reincarnation of one of the
witchetty grub people of the Alcheringa;" the nanja
tree, or stone, ever afterwards is the nanja of the child,
and there is special connection between it and the child,
injury to the nanja object meaning injury to the nanja
man.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> There is evidence that the reincarnation theory
is not admissible,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> and, indeed, it does not seem
warranted on the facts presented by the authors. With
this unnecessary element out of the way, then, there is
left a system of local totemism, arising at birth and
depending upon the mother, without reference in any
way to the father, associated with natural features, rocks
and trees, and showing in a special way a curious
system of sex cleavage by the men of the group being
the exclusive guardians of the sacred churinga, and the
women the active power by which the churinga becomes
connected with the newly-born member of the totem
group.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>Now at this point we may surely refer back to the
custom and belief of the Semang people of the Malay
Peninsula, and I suggest that we have the closest
parallel between Semang belief and custom and Arunta
totemism, not quite the same formula perhaps, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
assuredly the same fundamental conception of every
child at birth being in intimate association with objects
of nature, and this association being the determining
force of the newly-born man's social status and class,
lasting all through life. In each case the kinless
basis of totemism is thus fully shown. The totem
names given by women, or assumed on account of the
conditions attachable to women as mothers, did not
extend to the human fathers. The fathers may be
known or unknown to the mothers, but they did not
become associated with the totems which the mothers
associated with their children. To the extent of fatherhood,
therefore, totemism of this type was clearly not
based upon the natural fact of blood kinship, but upon
the conscious adoption of a non-kinship form of society.
To the extent of motherhood also it was not based upon
blood kinship, for it was the local totem, not the
mother's totem, which became the totem of the newly-born
member of the group. We thus have an entirely
non-kinship form of society to deal with, a kinless
society, "where there is no necessary relationship
of any kind between that of children and parents."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
Primitive man consciously adapted certain of his observations
of nature to his social needs, and among
these observations the fact of actual blood kinship
with father and mother played no part. It would appear
therefore that totemism at its foundation was
based upon a theoretical conception of relationship
between man and animal or plant. Place of birth,
association with natural objects, not motherhood and
not fatherhood, are the determining factors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
We may proceed to inquire as to the social form
which has become evolved from this kinless system.</p>

<p>In the case of the Semangs we have the kinless
totemic belief and custom existing within a kinless
society. In the case of the Arunta we have the kinless
totemism existing in a society based on a kinless
organisation still, but containing also full recognition
of motherhood,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and perhaps recognition of physical
fatherhood.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> There is, therefore, an important distinction
in the social position of the two parallel systems.
Among the Semang people, their totemic belief and
custom do not carry with them a superstructure of
society. They form the substantive cult of the
scattered social groups, which are kinless groups dependent
upon ties local in character and derived from
the conscious use of the facts of nature surrounding
them. Among the Arunta people, on the contrary, the
totem belief and custom are contained within a social
system of extraordinary dimensions and proportions.
Of course, the obvious questions to raise are&mdash;have the
Semang people lost a once existing social system connected
with their totemic cult? Have the Arunta
people had imposed upon them a social system which
has not destroyed their primitive totemic cult?</p>

<p>To answer these questions I can only deal with
the Semang evidence as it appears in researches of
great authority and weight, and there is undoubtedly
in all the evidence produced by Messrs. Skeat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
Blagden, and the authorities they use, nothing whatever
to suggest that Semang totemism once possessed
above it an elaborate social organisation of the usual
totemic type. There is indeed, the myth which points
to a two-class exogamous division for marital purposes,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
but there is more than myth for the unrestricted
intercourse of the sexes both before and after marital
rights.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> In every other direction we get simple
groups fashioned on no larger basis than nomadic
roaming and journeying to fresh food grounds. On
the other hand, there is much to suggest that the
Arunta have a dual system of organisation; one, in
which the primitive types are still surviving, the
second, a more advanced type which covers but does
not crush out the first. If this is so, it is clear that
the parallel between Semang and Arunta totemism is
considerably closer than at first appears.</p>

<p>It will be necessary, therefore, to deal with the two
principal signs of alleged Arunta progress, male
descent and the exogamous classes. I see no evidence
whatever of male descent; male ascendancy, a very
different thing, appears, but there cannot strictly be
male descent where fatherhood is unrecognised. And
here I would interpose the remark that the use of the
term descent, male descent and female descent, in
these studies is far too indiscriminate.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Descent means
succession by blood kinship by acknowledged sons or
daughters, and this is exactly what does not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
occur. Sonship and daughtership in our sense of the
term are not always known to savagery. They were
not known to the Arunta males, for fatherhood was
not recognised by them and motherhood was not definitely
used in the social sense. All that the Arunta
can be said to have developed is a mother-right society
with male ascendancy in the group.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Group sons
succeeded to group fathers, but individual descent
from father to son there is not.</p>

<p>There remain the exogamous classes. In the first
place, it is necessary to get rid of a difficulty raised by
Mr. Lang. "In no tribe with female descent can a
district have its local totem as among the Arunta....
This can only occur under male reckoning of descent."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
But surely so acute an observer as Mr. Lang would
see that with female descent right through, as it exists
among the Khasia and Kocch people of Assam, local
totem centres are just as possible as with male descent.
Mr. Lang is conscious of some discrepancy here, for
a little later on he repeats the statement that local totem
centres "can only occur and exist under male reckoning
of descent," but adds the significant qualification
"in cases where the husbands do not go to the
<ins class="correction" title="apostrophe missing in original">wives'</ins>
region of abode."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This is the whole point. Where
husbands do go to the wives' region of abode, as they
do among the Khasis and the Kocch, female descent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
would allow of the formation of local totem centres.
This is not far from the position of the Arunta. They
are mother-right societies. The mother secures the
totem name. The father, <i>de facto</i>, is not father according
to the ideas of the Arunta people, is at best
only one of a group of possible fathers according to
the practices of the Arunta people. Therefore, the
local totem centre is formed out of a system which may
be called a mother-right system for the purpose of
scientific description, but which is not even a mother-right
system to the natives, because motherhood is not
the foundation of the local group.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have the important fact, which Mr.
Lang has duly noted, though he does not apparently
see its significance in the argument as to origins, that
the class system "arose in a given centre and was
propagated by emigrants and was borrowed by distant
tribes."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Messrs. Spencer and Gillen distinctly affirm
that the "division into eight has been adopted (or
rather the names for the four new divisions have been)
in recent times by the Arunta tribe from the Ilpirra
tribe which adjoins the former on the north, and the
use of them is at the present time spreading southwards."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
This view is supported by the widespread
organisation of eaglehawk and crow, and by the
general homogeneity of Australian social forms. It is
clear, therefore, that room is made for the external
organisation of the class system and the consequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
production of the dual characteristics of the Arunta&mdash;the
joint product of the fossilisation of mother-right
society at the end of the migration movement, and the
superimposing upon this fossilisation, with its tendency
towards the class system, of the fully organised class
system. The two systems are not now fully welded in
the Arunta group. Whatever view is taken of these,
whether they be considered advanced or primal, the
undoubted dualism has to be accounted for, and the
best way of accounting for this dualism is, I submit,
that of differential evolution. Further study of Messrs.
Spencer and Gillen's work, together with the criticisms
of various scholars, Mr. Lang, Mr. Hartland, Mr.
Frazer, Mr. Thomas, and others, convinces me that
the extreme artificiality of the class system is due
partly to a want of understanding of the entire facts,
and partly to the <i>ad hoc</i> adoption by the natives themselves
of new plans to meet difficulties which must
arise out of a too close adhesion to their rules. Mr.
Lang has allowed me to see a manuscript note of his,
in which he points out that the inevitable result of
the one totem to the one totem rule of marital relationship,&mdash;that
is, totem A always intermarrying with
totem B, males and females from both totems, and
with no others,&mdash;is the consanguineous relationship of
all the members of the two totems. The rule for non-consanguineous
marriage has therefore broken down,
and when it breaks down the Australian introduces a
new rule which satisfies immediate necessities. When
this in turn breaks down a further new rule is made,
and this is the way I think the differing rules resulted.
They represent, therefore, not varying degrees of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
culture progress, but only varying degrees of artificial
social changes, and they spring from the oldest conditions
of all where there is no class system at all.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Arunta
society is not a "sport" under this view, but a product&mdash;a
product to be accounted for and explained by
anthropological rules, derived not only from Australian
society but from the general facts of human society
which have remained for observation by the science of
to-day. The parallel between Semang and Arunta,
therefore, helps us in two ways. It enables us to go back
to Semang totemism as an example of primitive kinless
society, and forward to Arunta totemism as an example of
early development therefrom. We have, in point of fact,
discovered the datum line of totemism. Upon this
may be constructed the various examples according to
their degrees of development, and we may thus see in
detail the commencing elements of totemism as well
as the means by which we may proceed from the commencing
elements to the more advanced elements, and
finally to the last stages of totemic society where
blood kinship is fully recognised and used, where, in
fact, totemic tribes as distinct from totemic peoples
take their place in the world's history.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>I do not propose in this chapter to proceed further
with this inquiry. It will not advance my object, nor
is it absolutely necessary. Totemism in the full has
been described adequately by Mr. Frazer in his valuable
abstract of the evidence supplied from all parts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
the world, and there is not much in dispute among the
authorities when once the stage of origin is passed.
There is danger, however, at the other extreme,
namely, the attempt to discover totemism in impossible
places in civilisation. Mr. Morgan has shown us totemic
society in its highest form of development, untouched
by other influences of sufficient consequence to divert
its natural evolution. This, I think, is the merit of
Mr. Morgan's great work, and not his attempt, his
futile attempt as I think, to apply the principles of
totemic society to the elucidation of societies that have
long passed the stage of totemism. In particular, the
great European civilisations are not totemic, nor are
they to be seen passing from totemism. It is true that
Mr. Lang, Mr. Grant Allen, and others have attempted
to trace in certain features of Greek ritual and belief,
and in certain tribal formations discoverable in Anglo-Saxon
Britain, the relics of a living totemism in the
civilised races of Europe;<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> but I do not believe
either of these scholars would have endorsed his
early conclusions in later studies. Mr. Grant Allen
did not, so far as I know, repeat this theory after
its first publication, and Mr. Lang has given many
signs of being willing to withdraw it. The fact is,
there is no necessity to think of Greek or English
totem society because in Greece and England there
are traces of totem beliefs. We may disengage them
from their national position and put them back to the
position they occupied before the coming of Greek or
Englishman into the countries they have made their own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
In that position there may well have been totemic
peoples in Britain of the type we have been considering
from Australia. I have already indicated that totemic
survivals in folklore have been the subject of a special
study of my own which still in the main stands good,
and for which I have collected very many additional
illustrations and proofs. I discovered that folklore
contained some remarkably perfect examples of totemic
belief and custom, and also a considerable array of
scattered belief and custom connected with animals
and plants which, unclassified, seemed to lead to no
definite stage of culture history, yet when classified,
undoubtedly led to totemism. The result was somewhat
remarkable. At many points there are direct parallels
to savage totemism, and the whole associated group of
customs received adequate explanation only on the
theory that it represented the detritus of a once existing
totemic system of belief.</p>

<p>The present study enables me to take the parallel to
primitive totemism much closer. One of the perfect
examples was of a local character. This was found in
Ossory. Giraldus Cambrensis tells an extraordinary
legend to the following effect: "A priest benighted in
a wood on the borders of Meath was confronted by a
wolf, who after some preliminary explanations gave
this account of himself: There are two of us, a man
and a woman, natives of Ossory, who through the
curse of one Natalis, saint and abbot, are compelled
every seven years to put off the human form and
depart from the dwellings of men. Quitting entirely
the human form, we assume that of wolves. At the
end of the seven years, if they chance to survive, two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
others being substituted in their places, they return to
their country and their former shape."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Here is a
saintly legend introduced to explain the current tradition
of the men of Ossory, that they periodically
turned into wolves. Fynes Moryson, in 1603, ridiculed
the beliefs of "some Irish who will be believed as men
of credit," that men in Ossory were "yearly turned
into wolves."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> But an ancient Irish MS. puts the
matter much more clearly in the statement that the
"descendants of the wolf are in Ossory,"<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> while the
evidence of Spenser and Camden explains the popular
beliefs upon even more exact lines. Spenser says
"that some of the Irish doe use to make the wolf
their gossip;"<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and Camden adds that they term them
"Chari Christi, praying for them and wishing them
well, and having contracted this intimacy, professed to
have no fear from their four-footed allies." Fynes
Moryson expressly mentions the popular dislike to
killing wolves, and they were not extirpated until the
eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Aubrey adds that "in Ireland
they value the fang-tooth of an wolfe, which they set in
silver and gold as we doe ye Coralls;"<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and Camden
notes the similar use of a bit of wolf's skin.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>In the local superstitions of Ossory, therefore, we
have several of the cardinal features of savage totemism,
the descent from the totem-animal, the ascription<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
to the totem of a sacred character, the belief in its protection,
and a taboo against killing it. I will venture
to suggest, however, that to these important features
there is to be added a parallel in survival to the Semang
and Arunta features where the local circumstances of
birth are the determining forces which supply the
totem name, for the relationship of "gossip," "god-sib,"
is clearly of the same character as that of the
soul-tree of the Semang and the alcheringa of the
Australian.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The condition of survival has altered the
detail of the parallel, but the parallel is on the same
plane.</p>

<p>The wolf as gossip to the men of Ossory leads us on
to inquire whether any other animal had such close
connections with human beings. In Erris, a part of
Connaught, "the people consider that foxes perfectly
understand human language, that they can be propitiated
by kindness, and even moved by flattery. They
not only make mittens for Reynard's feet to keep him
warm in winter, and deposit these articles carefully
near their holes, but they make them sponsors for
their children, supposing that under the close and long-established
relationship of Gossipred they will be
induced to befriend them."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Thus it appears that the
selfsame conception which the men of Ossory had in
the thirteenth century for the wolf, the men of Erris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
had for the fox in the nineteenth century. No explanation
from the dry details of the natural history
of these animals is sufficient to account for this curious
parallel, and we must turn to ancient beliefs for the
explanation.</p>

<p>The general attitude of the men of Erris towards the
fox is confirmed as an attribute of totemism when we
come to examine a special local form of it. This we
can do by turning to Galway. The Claddagh fishermen
in Galway would not go out to fish if they
saw a fox: their rivals of a neighbouring village, not
believing in the fox, do all they can to introduce a fox
into the Claddagh village.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> These people are peculiar
in many respects, and are distinctively clannish. They
retain their old clan-dress&mdash;blue cloaks and red petticoats&mdash;which
distinguishes them from the rest of the
county of Galway, and it may be conjectured that the
present-day custom of naming from the names of fish&mdash;thus,
Jack the hake, Bill the cod, Joe the eel, Pat the
trout, Mat the turbot, etc.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>&mdash;may be a remnant of the
mental attitude of the folk towards that belief in kinship
between men and animals which is at the basis
of totemism. But, returning to the fox, we have in
the belief that meeting this animal would prevent them
from going out to fish, a parallel to the prohibition
against looking at the totem which is to be found
among savage people, and we have in the neighbours'
disbelief in the fox and a corresponding belief in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
hare,<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> that local distribution of different totems which
is also found in savagery. But all these particulars
about the relationship of the fox to the Claddagh
fishermen receive unexpected light when we inquire
into the biography of their local saint, named MacDara.
This saint is the patron saint of the fishermen
who, when passing MacDara's island, always dip
their sails thrice to avoid being shipwrecked. But
then, in the folk-belief, we have this remarkable fact,
that MacDara's real name was Sinach, a fox<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>&mdash;an
instance, it would seem, of a totem cult being transferred
to a Christian saint. Thus, then, in the superstitions
of these Claddagh fisherfolk we can trace the
elements of totemism, the root of which is contained,
first, in the nominal worship of a Christian saint, and
second, in the actual worship of an animal, the fox.</p>

<p>These examples of local totemism may be followed by
a remarkable example of tribal or kinship totemism.
It was noted by Mr. G.&nbsp;H. Kinahan in his researches
for Irish folklore, and is mentioned quite incidentally
among other items, the collector himself not fully
perceiving the importance of his "find." This really
enhances the value of the evidence, because it destroys
any possibility of an objection to its validity&mdash;a really
important matter, considering the remarkable character
of this survival of totem-stocks in Western Europe.
The exact words of Mr. Kinahan are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In very ancient times some of the clan Coneely,
one of the early septs of the county, were changed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>
'art magick' into seals; since then no Coneely can
kill a seal without afterwards having bad luck. Seals
are called Coneelys, and on this account many of
the name changed it to Connolly."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> The same local
tradition is mentioned by Hardiman in one of his
notes to O'Flaherty's <i>Description of West or H-iar
Connaught</i>,<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> but the note is equally significant of
genuineness from the fact that the tradition is styled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
"a ridiculous story." It strengthens Mr. Kinahan's
note in the following passage: "In some places the
story has its believers, who would no more kill a seal,
or eat of a slaughtered one, than they would of a human
Coneely."</p>

<p>The clan Coneely is mentioned both by Mr. Kinahan
and by Mr. Hardiman as one of the oldest Irish septs;
and that it is widely spread, and not congregated into
one locality, is to be inferred from the description of
the tradition as prevalent in Connaught, especially
from Mr. Hardiman's words, describing that "in some
places" the story has its believers now; and hence
we may conclude that wherever the clan Coneely are
situated there would exist this totem belief.</p>

<p>The full significance of these facts may best be tested
by reference to the conditions laid down by Dr.
Robertson Smith for the discovery of the survivals
of totemism among the Semitic races. These conditions
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'(1) The existence of stocks named after plants and
animals'&mdash;such stocks, it is necessary to add, being scattered
through many local tribes; (2) the prevalence of the
conception that the members of the stock are of the blood
of the eponym animal, or are sprung from a plant of the
species chosen as totem; (3) the ascription to the totem of
a sacred character which may result in its being regarded
as the god of the stock, but at any rate makes it be regarded
with veneration, so that, for example, a totem animal is not
used as ordinary food. If we can find all these things
together in the same tribe, the proof of totemism is complete;
but even when this cannot be done, the proof may be
morally complete if all the three marks of totemism are
found well developed within the same race. In many cases,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
however, we can hardly expect to find all the marks of
totemism in its primitive form; the totem, for example, may
have become first an animal god, and then an anthropomorphic
god, with animal attributes or associations merely."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p></div>

<p>Now in the Irish case all three of these conditions
are found together in the same tribe, the clan Coneely,
and it is impossible to overlook the importance of such
a discovery. It proves from survivals in folklore that
totemistic people once lived in ancient Ireland, just as
the corresponding evidence proved that the ancient
Semitic stock possessed the totemic organisation.</p>

<p>We have now examined the most archaic forms of
the survival of totemism in Britain. If we pass on
to inquire whether we can detect the more scattered
and decayed remnants of totem beliefs and customs,
we turn to Mr. Frazer as our guide. From Mr.
Frazer's review of the beliefs and customs incidental
to the totemistic organisation of savage people, it is
possible to extract a formula for ascertaining the classification
of savage beliefs and practices incidental to
totemism. This formula appears to me to properly fall
into the following groups:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) Descent from the totem.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Restrictions against injuring the totem.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Restrictions against using the totem for food.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The petting and preservation of totems.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The mourning for and burying of totems.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Penalties for non-respect of totem.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Assistance by the totem to his kin.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) Assumption of totem marks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
(<i>i</i>) Assumption of totem dress.</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>) Assumption of totem names.</p></div>

<p>My suggestion is that if a reasonable proportion of
the superstitions and customs attaching to animals and
plants, preserved to us as folklore, can be classified
under these heads this is exactly what might be expected
if the origin of such superstitions and customs is to be
sought for in a primitive system of totemism which
prevailed amongst the people once occupying these
islands. The clan Coneely and the Ossory wolves are
proofs that such a system existed, and if such perfect
survivals have been able to descend to modern times,
in spite of the influences of civilisation, there is no
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i> reason why the beliefs and customs incidental
to such a system should not have survived, even
though they are no longer to be identified with special
clans. When once a primitive belief or custom becomes
separated from its original surroundings, it would be
liable to change. Thus, when the wolf totem of Ossory
passes into a local cultus, we meet with the belief that
human beings may be transformed into animal forms,
as the derivative from the totem belief in descent from
the wolf. Fortunately, the process by which this
change took place is discernible in the Ossory example;
but it will not be so in other examples, and
we may therefore assume that the Ossory example
represents the transitional form and apply it as a key
to the origin of similar beliefs elsewhere.</p>

<p>Again, if we endeavour to discover how the associated
totem-beliefs of the clan Coneely would appear
in folklore supposing they had been scattered by the
influences of civilisation, we can see that at the various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>
places where members of the clan had resided for some
time there would be preserved fragments of the once
perfect totem-belief. Thus, one place would retain traditions
about a fabulous animal who could change into
human form; another place would preserve beliefs about
its being unlucky to kill a seal (or some other animal
specially connected with the locality); another place
would preserve a superstitious regard for the seal (or
some other local animal) as an augury; and thus the
process of transference of beliefs into folklore, from
one form into other related forms, from one particular
object connected with the clan to several objects connected
with the localities, would go on from time to
time, until the difficulty of tracing the original of the
scattered beliefs and customs would be well-nigh insurmountable
without some key. But having once
proved the existence of such examples as the clan
Coneely and the Ossory wolves, this difficulty, though
still great, is very much lessened. Our method would
be as follows. We first of all postulate that totem
peoples did actually exist in ancient Britain, or whence
such extraordinary survivals? We next examine and
classify the beliefs and customs which are incidental to
totemism in savage society, and having set these forth
by the aid of Mr. Frazer's admirable study on the
subject, we ascertain what parallels to these beliefs and
customs may be found in the folklore of Britain. And
then our position seems to be very clearly defined. We
prove that in folklore certain customs and superstitions
are identical, or nearly so, with the beliefs and customs
of totemism among savage tribes, and we conclude that
this identity in form proves an identity in origin, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
therefore that this section of folklore originated from
the totemistic people of early Britain.</p>

<p>I shall not take up all these points on the present
occasion, especially as they have in all essentials appeared
in the study to which I have referred; but as an
example of the scattering of totem beliefs I will refer
to the well-known passage in C&aelig;sar (lib. v. cap. xii.),
from which we learn that certain people in Britain
were forbidden to eat the hare, the cock, or the goose,
and see whether this does not receive its only explanation
by reference to the totemic restriction against
using the totem for food. Mr. Elton, with this
passage in his mind, notices that "there were certain
restrictions among the Britons and ancient Irish, by
which particular nations or tribes were forbidden to
kill or eat certain kinds of animals;" and he goes on to
suggest that "it seems reasonable to connect the rule
of abstaining from certain kinds of food with the
superstitious belief that the tribes were descended from
the animals from which their names and crests or
badges were derived."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Let us see whether this reasonable conjecture holds
good. The most famous example is that of Cuchulainn,
the celebrated Irish chieftain, whose name means
the hound of Culain. It is said that he might not eat
of the flesh of the dog, and he came by his death
after transgressing this totemistic taboo. The words
of the manuscript known as the Book of Leinster are
singularly significant in their illustration of this view.
"And one of the things that C&uacute;chulainn was bound
not to do was going to a cooking hearth and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
consuming the food [<i>i.e.</i> the dog]; and another of the
things that he must not do was eating his namesake's
flesh."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Diarmaid, whose name seems to be
continued in the current popular Irish name for pig
(Darby), was intimately associated with that animal,
and his life depended on the life of the boar.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
These examples are so much to the point that we
may examine the cases mentioned by C&aelig;sar from
the same standard.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer points out that even among existing
totem-tribes the respect for the totem has lessened or
disappeared, and among the results of this he notes
instances where, if any one kills his totem, he apologises
to the animal. Under such an interpretation as
this, we may surely classify a "memorandum" made
by Bishop White-Kennett about the hare, the first of
the British totems mentioned by C&aelig;sar: "When one
keepes a hare alive and feedeth him till he have occasion
to eat him, if he telles before he kills him that
he will doe so, the hare will thereupon be found dead,
having killed himself."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> But respect for the hare, in
accordance with totem ideas, was carried further than
this at Biddenham, where, on the 22nd September, a
little procession of villagers carried a white rabbit
[a substitute for hare] decorated with scarlet ribbons
through the village, singing a hymn in honour of
St. Agatha. All the young unmarried women who
chanced to meet the procession extended the first two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
fingers of the left hand pointing towards the rabbit, at
the same time repeating the following doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gustin, Gustin, lacks a bier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maidens, maidens, bury him here.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This points to a very ancient custom, not yet fully
explained, but which clearly had for its object the
reverential burying of a rabbit or hare. It is characteristic
of the totem animal that it serves as an omen
to its clansmen, and we find that the hare is an
omen in Britain. Boudicca is said to have drawn
an augury from a hare, taken from her bosom, and
which when released pursued a course that was deemed
fortunate for her attack upon the Roman army;<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and
in modern south Northamptonshire the running of a
hare along the street or mainway of a village portends
fire to some house in the immediate vicinity.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> In 1648
Sir Thomas Browne tells us that in his time there were
few above three-score years that were not perplexed
when a hare crossed their path.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> In Wilts and in
Scotland it was unlucky to meet a hare, but the evil
influence did not extend after the next meal had been
taken.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Then, too, the prohibition against naming
the totem object is found in north-east Scotland
attached to the hare, whose name may not be pronounced
at sea, and Mr. Gregor adds the significant
fact that some animal names and certain family names<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
were never pronounced by the inhabitants of some of
the villages, each village having an aversion to one
or more of the words.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> A classification of the beliefs
and customs connected with the hare takes us, indeed,
to almost every phase of totemistic belief, and it is
impossible to reject such a mass of cumulative evidence.</p>

<p>Of the second of the British food taboos mentioned by
C&aelig;sar we have the most perfect illustration in the
instance of the Irish chieftain, Conaire, who, descended
from a fowl, was interdicted from eating its flesh.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>Turning next to the goose, we find that at Great
Crosby, in Lancashire, there is held an annual
festival which is called the "Goose Fair," and although
it is accompanied by great feasting, the
singular fact remains that the goose itself, in whose
honour the feast seems to have been held, is considered
too sacred to eat, and is never touched by the
villagers.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> In Scotland also the goose was never
eaten, being too sacred for food.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Thus the hare, the fowl, and the goose have retained
their sacred character in a special manner in various
parts of the country, and I may add a further note of
more general significance. In Scotland there exists
a prejudice against eating hares and cocks and hens.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
In the south-western parts of England the peasant
would not eat hares, rabbits, wild-fowl, or poultry,
and when asked whence this dislike proceeds, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
asserts that it was derived from his father<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>&mdash;the
traditional sanction which is so essential to folklore.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>The ideas surrounding these three special animals
might be easily extended to others, but I will only
observe that Mr. Elton, noting both the classical and
modern accounts of certain districts in Scotland and
Ireland where fish, though abundant, is tabooed as food,
quotes with approval a modern suggestion that this
abstinence was a religious observance.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> That fish
are carved on numerous stones is a curious commentary
on this assertion, while another point to be noted is
that the inhabitants of the various islands have each
their peculiar notions as to what fish are good for
food. Some will eat skate, some dog-fish, some eat
limpets and razor-fish, and as a matter of course, says
Miss Gordon Cumming, those who do not, despise
those who do.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> A prejudice also existed against white
cows in Scotland, and Dalyell ventures upon the acute
supposition that this was on account of the unlawfulness
of consuming the product of a consecrated
animal.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> These are not stray notes of inexperienced
observers, and with two centuries between them it
must be that they contain the essence of the people's
conception&mdash;a conception which leads us back to
totemism for its explanation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
I do not think we could get closer to totemic beliefs
and ideas than this, nor could we have a better example
of the necessity of examining early historical
data by anthropological tests and by folklore parallels.
C&aelig;sar's words are unimportant by themselves. They
convey nothing of any significance to the modern
reader&mdash;a mere dietetic peculiarity which means nothing
and counts for nothing. And yet it might be considered
certain that C&aelig;sar knew that the details he
recorded were of importance in the historical sense.
He did not indicate what the importance was, probably
because he was not aware of it; but because
he was conscious that among the influences which
counted with these people were the food taboos, he
rightly recorded the facts. They have remained unconsidered
trifles until now, when anthropology has
brought them within the range of scientific observation,
and they are now to be reckoned with as part
of the material which tells of the culture conditions
of a section of the early British peoples.</p>

<p>I must here interpose a remark with reference to
this grouping of the evidence. Apart from the significance
of the superstitions as they are recorded in their
bare condition among the peasantry, there is the
additional fact to note that the superstition against
eating or killing certain animals or birds, or against
looking at them or naming them, etc., is not universal.
It obtains in one place and not in another. If the injunction
not to kill, injure, or eat a certain animal were
simply the reflection of a universal practice, such a
practice might originate in some attribute of the animal
itself which characteristically would produce or tend to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
produce superstition. But the spread of this class of
superstition in certain districts, and not in others, is
indicative of an ancient origin, and it is exactly what
might be expected to have been produced from totem-peoples.
Unfortunately, neither the negative evidence
of superstitious beliefs nor the local distribution of
superstitious beliefs has ever been considered worthy
of attention. But some little evidence is incidentally
forthcoming, and I would submit that this may be
taken as indicative of what might be obtained more
fully by further research into this neglected aspect of
folklore. I drew Miss Burne's attention to this
subject, and she has noted some particulars in her
valuable <i>Shropshire Folklore</i>.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> But for the most part
this portion of our evidence wants picking out by a long
and tedious process from the mass of badly recorded facts
about popular superstitions. I do not believe in the
generally stated opinion that certain superstitions are
universally believed or practised. It is difficult to
prove a negative, and such evidence is not absolutely
scientific, but when it comes in direct antithesis to
positive, there does not seem any harm in accepting
it. Every class of superstition wants tracing out
geographically, and local variants want careful
noting. I cannot doubt if this were properly done
that many so-called universal superstitions would be
found to be distinctly local. In the meantime, it
is not with universal superstitions that we have to
deal. It is primarily with those local variants which
show us side by side the differences of belief. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
thus that we can afford evidence of that intermixture
of totem-objects which is to be expected from the
known facts of totem-beliefs and customs. Indeed,
Mr. McLennan has laid it down that "we might
expect that while here and there perhaps a tribe
might appear with a single animal god, as a general
rule tribes and nations should have as many animal
and vegetable gods as there were distinct stocks in
the population ... we should not expect to find the
same animal dominant in all quarters, or worshipped
even everywhere within the same nation."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>It is important that we should thoroughly understand
what these survivals of totemism in the British
isles really mean. On the extreme west coast of
Ireland, farthest away from the centres of civilisation,
there are found these unique examples of a savage
institution. The argument that they might have been
transplanted thither by travellers from the far west,
where totemism has developed to its highest form,
cannot seriously be advanced. The argument that
they might be the accidental form into which some
merely superstitious fancies of ignorant peasants
happened to have ultimately shaped themselves, is
met by the mathematical demonstration that the ratio
of chance against such a development would be well-nigh
incalculable. The remaining argument is that
they indicate the last outpost, or perhaps one of the
last outposts, of a primitive savage organisation
which once existed throughout these lands. This is
the view that appears to me to be the only possible
one to meet all the conditions of the case; one proof in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
support of this view being the discovery of evidence in
other parts of the country which shows that totemism has
left its stamp in more or less perfect form upon the traditional
beliefs and practices of the nation. Though we
are not able to identify further complete examples of
the same type as the seal clan of Western Ireland, or
the wolf people of Ossory, we should be able, if the
explanation I have advanced of their origin be the
correct one, to produce examples of the varying forms
which such an institution as totemism must have
assumed when it had been broken up by the advance
of civilising influences. If the seal clan, or the wolf
clan, is in truth the last outpost of a savage organisation,
there will be in the lands less remote from the
centres of civilisation some evidences of the break-up
of savagery as it has been driven westward. Somewhere
in tradition, somewhere in local observances
of beliefs or superstition, there must still be echoes,
more or less faint, but still echoes, from totemism.
Having discovered these undoubted examples of
totemism, the argument shifts its ground. We can
no longer say that the theory of totemism may possibly
explain some of the customs and traditions of the
people. We are, by the logic of the position, compelled
to say that custom and tradition must have
preserved many relics of totemism, and that so far
from seeking to explain custom and tradition by the
theory of totemism, we must seek to explain the
survival of totemism by custom and tradition. I lay
stress on this view of the case because it is hard to
combat the views of those who look upon "mere superstition"
as no explanation of primitive originals. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
us of the present day the beliefs of the peasantry are
no doubt properly definable as "mere superstition."
But when we examine it as folklore we are seeking for
its origin, not for its modern aspect; we are asking
how "mere superstition" first arose, and in what
forms, not how it exists; we are pushing back the
inquiry from to-day when it exists side by side with a
philosophical and moral religion to the time when it
existed as the sole substitute for philosophy and
morals. Even if it is "mere superstition" it has a
dateless history. It is not conceivable that it suddenly
arose at a particular period before which "mere
superstition" did not exist, and all, both peasant and
chief, were philosophical and moral. It is not conceivable
that the mere superstition of to-day has replaced
bodily the mere superstition of other ages.
Every succeeding age of progress has influenced it,
no doubt, but not eradicated it, and hence the mere
superstition of to-day has just such an unbroken continuity
of history as language or institutions. That
we are able to pick out from among its items undoubted
forms of totemism, and that we may add to
these complete examples a classified grouping of
customs and beliefs in survival parallel to the customs
and beliefs of savage totemism, affords proof that at
least we may carry back that history to the era of
totemism, at whatever point that era may cross the line
of, or come into contact with, political history.</p>

<p>This is the definite conclusion to be drawn from
the anthropological interpretation of the presence of
totemic beliefs among the survivals of folklore. The
study of the anthropological conditions has occupied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
a wide range of thought and inquiry, but it leads
us back to a safe basis for research, for it brings
definitely within touch of that realm of man which lies
outside the civilisation wherein folklore is embedded,
the peoples who have made, and the peoples who are
dominated by, that civilisation. The savage of Britain
cannot with this evidence before us be considered as the
mere product of the literature of Greece and Rome. He
is part and parcel of the savagery of the human race.
Anthropology has shown us that savagery reached the
land we now call Britain as part of the general movement
of people which has caused the whole earth to
become a dwelling-place for man, and now that we
know this we must appeal to anthropology whenever
we find that the problems of folklore take us out of the
culture period of a civilisation known to history.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<h4>APPENDIX</h4>

<p>I append a synopsis of the culture-structure of the
Semangs of the Malay Peninsula (references are to
Skeat and Blagden's <i>Pagan Races of the Malay
Peninsula</i> where not otherwise specified), in order that
the position claimed for the one section of totemic
belief may be tested by the remaining characteristics
of Semang culture. I claim that there is nothing that
remains which is inconsistent with the interpretation
given of the totemic items.</p>

<p><i>Physical</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>). Live exclusively in the forest surrounded by
hostile fauna (i. 13).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>). Food consists of such wild vegetable food as
may happen to fall from time to time in season (i. 109,
341, 525), together with small mammals and birds
(i. 112), fish (i. 113).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>). As soon as they have exhausted the sources of
food in one neighbourhood they move on to the next
(i. 109).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>). Fire obtained by friction (i. 111, 113), but meat
is eaten raw (i. 112).</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>). Nudity is alleged (<i>Journ. Indian Archipelago</i>,
i. 252; ii. 258); no satisfactory proof (i. 137); do not
use skins of animals nor feathers of birds (i. 138); a
girdle of fungus string (i. 138, 142, 380); fringe of
leaves suspended from a string (i. 139, 142); necklaces
and ligatures of jungle fibre (i. 144, 145); women wear
a comb made of bamboo as a charm against diseases
(i. 149).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
(<i>f</i>). Habitations are rock shelters (i. 173), tree shelters
afforded by branches of trees improved by construction
of a weather screen (i. 174); ground screen of palm
leaves (i. 175).</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>). Hunt successfully the largest animals, escaping
easily up the trees (i. 202-204).</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>). Knives made of bamboo, flakes and chips of stone,
knives of bone (i. 249, 269); bow and arrow (i. 251, 255);
not sufficiently advanced to have produced neolithic
implements (i. 268); wooden spear (i. 270).</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>). Ignorant of pottery, vessels made from big stems
of bamboo (i. 383).</p>

<p><i>Social</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>j</i>). Chief of the group is the principal medicine man,
but is on an equal footing with his men, no caste and
property is in common (i. 497, 499).</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>). Marriage rights are secured by the presentation
of a jungle knife to the bride's parents and a girdle to
the bride, and the bride never lets the girdle part from
her for fear of its being used to her prejudice in some
magic ceremony; adultery is punishable by death
(ii. 58, 59) [but this information was not obtained from
the most primitive of the Semang people].</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>). Semang women are common to all men (Newbold,
<i>Political and Stat. Acc. of Settlements in Straits of
Malacca</i>, ii. 379). Great ante-nuptial freedom (ii. 56,
218); "Of the Semang I have not had an opportunity
of personally judging" (ii. 377, Newbold).</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>(<i>m</i>). Eat dead kindred except head (Newbold, ii. 379);
burial takes place in the ground, and the older practice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>was exposure in trees; the Semang have no dread of
ghosts of the deceased (ii. 89, 91).</p>

<p>(<i>n</i>). No sacred shrines or places (ii. 197).</p>

<p>(<i>o</i>). Avoidance of mother-in-law (ii. 204).</p>

<p>(<i>p</i>). Myth of the ringdove informing the children of
the first woman that they had married within prohibited
degrees of consanguinity, and advising them to separate
and marry "other people" (ii. 218).</p>

<p>(<i>q</i>). Myth as to ignorance of cause of birth being
dispelled by the cocoanut monkey informing the first
man and woman (ii. 218).</p>

<p>(<i>r</i>). The Semang are almost ineradicably nomadic,
have no fixed habitation, and rove about like the beasts
of the forest (i. 172; ii. 470).</p>

<p>(<i>s</i>). Women and girls are not allowed to eat until the
men and boys have finished their repast (i. 116); the
men do most of the hunting and trapping, and the
women take a large share in the collecting of roots and
fruits; all the cooking is performed by the women and
girls (i. 375).</p>

<p>(<i>t</i>). They are split up into a large number of dialects,
each of which is confined to a relatively small area, and
it often happens that a little [clan] or even a single family
uses a form of speech which is differentiated from other
dialects to be practically unintelligible to all except the
members of the little community itself (ii. 379).</p>

<p>(<i>u</i>). Natural segregation of the [tribes] into small
[clans] to some extent cut off from one another and
surrounded by settled Malay communities (ii. 379).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg&nbsp;300]</a></span>
(<i>v</i>). The most thoroughly wild and uncivilised
members of our race, regarded by the Malays as little
better than brute beasts, with no recorded history
(ii. 384).</p>

<p>(<i>w</i>). Nomadic life of the Semang leads them over a
considerable tract of country (ii. 388).</p>

<p><i>Psychical</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>x</i>). Decorative patterns on quivers representing
natural objects, and possessing magical virtue to bring
down various species of monkeys and apes and other
small mammals (i. 417), and as charms for the
men (i. 423).</p>

<p>(<i>y</i>). Decorative pattern on magic comb worn by
women to serve as a charm against venomous reptiles
and insects, similar design for similar reason sometimes
painted on the breast (i. 41, 420-436).</p>

<p>(<i>z</i>). Child's name is taken from some tree which
stands near the prospective birthplace of the child.
As soon as the child is born this name is shouted aloud
by the <i>sage femme</i>, who then hands over the child to
another woman, who buries the afterbirth underneath
the birth-tree or name-tree of the child. As soon as
this is done the father cuts a series of notches in the
tree, starting from the ground and terminating at the
height of the breast. The cutting of these notches is
intended to signalise the arrival on earth of a new
human being, since it thus shows that Kari registers
the souls that he has sent forth by notching the tree
against which he leans. Trees thus "blazed" are
never felled. The child must not in later life injure
any tree which belongs to the species of his tree; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>
him all such trees are taboo, and he must not even eat
their fruit, the only exception being when an expectant
mother revisits her birth-tree. Every tree
of its species is regarded as identical with the birth-tree
(ii. 3, 4). When an East Semang dies his birth-tree
dies too (ii. 5).</p>

<p>(<i>aa</i>). The child's soul is conveyed in a bird, which
always inhabits a tree of the species to which the birth-tree
belongs. It flies from one tree of the species to
another, following the as yet unborn body. The souls
of first-born children are always young birds newly
hatched, the offspring of the bird which contained the
soul of the mother. If the mother does not eat the
soul-bird during her accouchement the child will be
stillborn or will die shortly after birth (ii. 4, 192, 194,
216). She keeps the soul-bird within the birth-bamboo,
and does not eat it all at once, but piecemeal (ii. 6).
All human souls grow upon a soul-tree in the other
world, whence they are fetched by a bird which was
killed and eaten by the expectant mother (ii. 194).</p>

<p>(<i>bb</i>). Semang religion, in spite of its recognition of
a thunder-god (Kari) and certain minor deities (so
called), has very little indeed in the way of ceremonial,
and appears to consist mainly of mythology and
legend. It shows remarkably few traces of demon
worship, very little fear of ghosts of the deceased, and
still less of any sort of animistic beliefs (ii. 174).
[As the Kari is the deity common to the Semang
and the people higher in culture than the Semang,
it is difficult to trace out the primitive idea. The
myths also show a common impress, "which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
probably mainly due to the same savage Malay element"
(ii. 183).]</p>

<p>(<i>cc</i>). During a storm of thunder and lightning the
Semang draw a few drops of blood from the region of
the shin bone, mix it with a little water in a bamboo
receptacle, and throw it up to the angry skies (ii. 204).</p>

<p>(<i>dd</i>). Pretend entire ignorance of a supreme being,
but on pressure confessed to a very powerful yet
benevolent being, the maker of the world (ii. 209).</p>

evidence, though it has been little noted. Thus "the Coles are evidently

civilisation that they be kept moving by continued Aryan propulsion.

Some of these contain unexpected corroboration from actual discoveries.
Thus the natives of New Zealand had a tradition that their ancestors,
when they arrived in their canoes some four centuries ago, buried some
sacred things under a large tree. It is said that the tree was blown
down in recent times and that the sacred things were discovered. Taplin
records "a good specimen of the kind of migration which has taken
place among the aborigines all over the continent" (<i>The Narrinyeri</i>, p. 4);
and similar evidence could be produced in almost every direction.
Mr. Mathew in <i>Eaglehawk and Crow</i> deals with "the argument from
mythology and tradition" as to the origin of the Australians in a very
suggestive fashion (pp. 14-22). Stanley has preserved an African native
tradition of local groups spreading out from the parent home <i>(Through
the Dark Continent</i>, i. 346).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_300_300" id="Footnote_300_300"></a><a href="#FNanchor_300_300"><span class="label">[300]</span></a> I am aware this is disputed by O. Peschel&mdash;<i>Races of Man</i>, 137 <i>et
seq.</i>&mdash;but I think the evidence is sufficient; and it must be remembered
that there is direct evidence of the most backward races not using the fire
they possess for cooking, but always eating their animal food raw, as, for
instance, the Semang people of the Malay Peninsula. (See Skeat and
Blagden, <i>Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula</i>, i. 112.) The Andaman
Islanders could not make fire, though they possessed and kept it alive.
This shows that they must have borrowed it and did not previously
possess it.&mdash;Quatrefages, <i>The Pygmies</i>, 108. Tylor, <i>Early History of
Mankind</i>, cap. ix., should be consulted.</p></div>

specially modern use, but it is the only term which, in its early sense,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_302_302" id="Footnote_302_302"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302_302"><span class="label">[302]</span></a> It was one of the first efforts of the science of language to endeavour
to trace out the original home of the so-called Aryas and their subsequent
migrations. "Emigration," said Bunsen, "is the great agent in forming
nations and languages" (<i>Philosophy of Hist.</i>, i. 56); and Niebuhr, who
has traced out most of the migrations of the Greek tribes, observes that
"this migration of nations was formerly not mentioned anywhere"
(<i>Anc. Hist.</i>, ii. 212). Quite recently, Professor Flinders Petrie has worked
at the question of European migrations in the Huxley lecture of 1907
(<i>Journ. Anthrop. Inst.</i>, xxxvi. 189-232), his valuable maps showing "the
movements of twenty of the principal peoples that entered Europe during
the centuries of great movements that are best known to us" (204). In
the meantime, the folklorist has much to do in this direction, and up to
the present he has almost entirely ignored or misread the evidence. I
do not know whether Mr. Nutt would still adhere to his conclusion that
the myth embodied in the Celtic expulsion-and-return formula is undoubtedly
solar (<i>Folklore Record</i>, iv. 42), but a restatement of Mr.
Nutt's careful and elaborate analysis would lead me to trace the myth to
the migration period of Aryan history, just as I agree with von Ihering
that the <i>ver sacrum</i> of the Romans is a rite continued from the migration
period to express in religious formul&aelig;, and on emergency to again carry
out, the ancient practice of sending forth from an overstocked centre
sufficient of the tribesmen and tribeswomen to leave those who remained
economically well-conditioned (<i>The Evolution of the Aryan</i>, 249-290).
Pheidon's law at Corinth, alluded to by Aristotle (<i>Pol.</i>, ii. cap. vi.), could
only be carried out by a sending out of the surplus. See also Aristotle,
<i>Pol.</i>, ii. cap. xii.; and Newman's note to the first reference, quoting similar
laws elsewhere. Both the "junior-right" traditions and customs take us
back to the same conditions. The occupation of fresh territories is an
observable feature of the Russian mir (Wallace, <i>Russia</i>, i. 255; Laveleye
<i>Primitive Property</i>, 34), and Mr. Chadwick has recently called attention
to the corresponding Scandinavian evidence (<i>Origin of the English
Nation</i>, 334).</p></div>

name given to the marriage ceremony performed in honour of a newly
planted orchard, without which preliminary observance it is not proper
to partake of its fruit. A man holding the Salagram personates the
bridegroom, and another holding the sacred Tulsi personates the bride.
After burning a hom or sacrificial fire, the officiating Brahmin puts the
usual questions to the couple about to be united. The bride then perambulates
a small spot marked out in the centre of the orchard. Proceeding
from the south towards the west, she makes the circuit three
times, followed at a short distance by the bridegroom holding in his hand
a strip of her chadar of garment. After this, the bridegroom takes
precedence, making his three circuits, and followed in like manner by
his bride. The ceremony concludes with the usual offerings" (Elliot,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_364_364" id="Footnote_364_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_364_364"><span class="label">[364]</span></a> Myths explaining the domestication of animals belong to this stage
of culture. The dog is a sacred animal among the Khasis, with certain
totemic associations, and there is a very realistic and humanising myth
relating how the dog came to be regarded as the friend of man (Gurdon,
<i>The Khasis</i>, 51, 172-3). The Kyeng creation legend includes a good
example of animal friendship with man (Lewin, <i>Wild Races of South-east
India</i>, 238-9). The American creation myths afford remarkable testimony
to this view of the case. "Game and fish of all sorts were under
direct divine supervision ... maize or Indian corn is a transformed
god who gave himself to be eaten to save men from hunger and death"
(Curtin, <i>Creation Myths of Primitive America</i>, pp. xxvi, xxxviii). The
Narrinyeri Australians "do not appear to have any story of the origin
of the world, but nearly all animals they suppose anciently to have been
men who performed great prodigies, and at last transformed themselves
into different kinds of animals and stones" (Taplin, <i>The Narrinyeri</i>,
59).</p></div>

says it "signified a <i>relation</i> or sponsor in baptism, all of whom were to
each other and to the parents <i>God-sibs</i>, that is, <i>sib</i>, or related by means
of religion." This meaning does not seem to have died out in the
days of Spenser, and his use of the word to describe the relationship of
the men of Ossory to wolves is very significant. For the history of this

Island off the coast of Donegal (Joyce, <i>Irish Place-Names</i>, ii. 282); and
some Shetland legends of the seal will be found in <i>Soc. Antiq. Scot.</i>,

<i>Western Islands</i>, 36), and one called the Virgin Mary's Seal is offered
to the minister (Reeves, <i>Adamnan Vita. Columb.</i>, 78, note <i>g</i>). The
attitude of the Irish to seals is shown by the two following notes:&mdash;
"At Erris, in Ireland, seals are considered to be human beings under
enchantment, and they consider it unlucky to have anything to do with
seals, and to have one live near their dwelling is considered as productive
of evil to life and property. A story current, in 1841, describes how a
young fisherman came in a fog upon an island whereon lived these
enchanted men in their human form, but when they quitted it they
turned to seals again" (Otway, <i>Sketches of Erris</i>, 398, 403). Off Downpatrick
Head they used to take seals, but have given up the practice,
because once two young fellows had urged their curraghs into a cave where
the seals were known to breed, and they were killing them right and
left when, in the farthest end of the cave and sitting up on its bent tail
in a corner, there sat an old seal. One of the boys was just making
ready to strike him, when the seal cried out, "Och, boys! och, ma
bouchals, spare your old grandfather, Darby O'Dowd." He then proceeded
to tell the boys his story. "It's true I was dead and dacently
buried, but here I am for my sins turned into a sale as other sinners are
and will be, and if you put an end to me and skin me maybe it's
worser I'll be, and go into a shark or a porpoise. Lave your ould forefather
where he is, to live out his time as a sale. Maybe for your own
sakes you will ever hereafter leave off following and parsecuting and
murthering sales who may be nearer to yourselves nor you think." The
story is universally believed, and on the strength of it the people have
given up seal hunting (Otway, <i>Sketches of Erris</i>, 230).</p></div>

may prove to have a still more direct bearing upon British folklore, for
Huxley's opinion as to the Australoid race is not entirely to be neglected.
He argued that "The Australoid race are dark complexion, ranging
through various shades of light and dark chocolate colour; dark or
black eyes; the hair of the scalp black and soft, silky and wavy; the
skull dolichocephalic. The great continent of Australia is the headquarters
of the Australoid race.... The Dekkan, which is so remarkably
isolated on the north by the valleys of the Ganges and Indus,
beyond these by the Himalaya Mountains, and on the east and west by
the sea, was originally inhabited, and is still largely peopled by men
who completely come under the definition of the Australoid race given
above. In Abyssinia and Egypt there is a smooth-haired, dark-complexioned,
long-headed stock which I am strongly inclined to regard as
a westward extension of the Australoid race. I would venture to suggest
that the dark whites who stretch from Northern Hindostan through
Western Asia, skirt both shores of the Mediterranean, and extend
through Western Europe to Ireland, may have had their origin in a
prolongation of the Australoid race, which has become modified by
selection or intermixture" (Huxley in <i>Prehistoric Congress, 1868</i>, pp.
92-94). This point of view is confirmed by Mr. Mathew's conclusions,

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>erhaps the most important part of the anthropological
aspect of custom, rite, and belief in
tradition is sociological. Perhaps, too, it is the
most neglected. Inquirers into the origin of religion
proceed one after the other to investigate the phenomena
of early beliefs as they interpret the origin of religion,
without one thought of the sociological conditions of the
problem. They interpose, as I have already pointed out,
the theory of a state religion, when such a foundation is
incidentally found to be necessary to carry the imposing
superstructure of Celtic mythology, but they do not
pause to inquire whether the state, suddenly introduced
into the argument, is a discoverable factor; or they
proceed to erect their superstructure of religious origins
without any social foundation whatever, and we are
left with a great concept of abstract thought having no
roots in the source from which it is supposed to be
drawn. The sun-god and the dawn-god, even the
All-father, are traced in the most primitive thought of
man, but it is not deemed necessary to show in what
relation these concepts stand to practical life. It is
here I must refer back to Robertson-Smith's dictum on
mythology, for it is the necessary preliminary to showing
that belief cannot enter into life except through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
sociological units into which all humanity fits itself; or
rather, I would prefer Robertson-Smith's way of putting
it, "the circle into which a man was born was not
simply a human society, a circle of kinfolk and fellow-citizens,
but embraced also certain divine beings, the
gods of the family and the state, which to the ancient
mind were as much a part of the particular community
with which they stood connected as the human members
of the social group."<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Any proposal to examine a
group of customs, beliefs, and rites which at their
origin take us back to the earliest history of a country
must, therefore, be considered from the sociological
side. The great mass of the material to be used in such
an inquiry is not ancient so far as its date of record is
a test of antiquity, but it is ancient as traditional
survival, and it is not possible to trace back custom and
belief surviving in modern times to the earliest times,
except through the medium of the institutions which
formed the social basis of the peoples to whom such
custom and belief belonged. A custom or belief exists
as a living force before it sinks back into the position of
a survival. It is the lingering effect of this living force
which helps to preserve it for so many ages, and in
the midst of such adverse circumstances, as a survival
among other customs and beliefs existing under a
different living force. It is not possible, therefore, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
ascertain the origin of custom or belief in survival,
except as a fragment of the social institution to which
it originally belonged. No custom or belief has a life
of its own separate from all other. It is joined to
other customs and beliefs in indissoluble co-partnership,
the whole group making up the institutions under
which the race or people to whom they belong live and
flourish. This, as we have already seen, is a most
important principle in the study of survivals. Not only
is it strictly true of all primitive peoples, but it is true
of the early stages of more advanced communities.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
Indeed it has been put into a phrase used long ago by
an English writer on the manorial tenant, "His religion
is a part of his copyhold,"<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and when the jurist talks
to us in highly technical language of lords, freeholders,
villans, and serfs, we must bear in mind that at any rate
these villans and serfs belonged to a social institution,
one element of which was religion. So, too, must
the folklorist bear in mind that it is not the individual
belief he is concerned with, but with the belief that
belongs to a community. It must be assumed that the
true test of the antiquity of every custom or belief is its
natural and easy assimilation with other customs and
beliefs, equally with itself in the position of a survival,
and the recognition of the whole group thus brought
into relationship as belonging to the institutions of the
people from whom it is derived.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>
It is well to understand what this condition of things
exactly means as an element in the study of early
beliefs. It will be dealing with beliefs from their place
in the social habitat; housing them, so to speak, within
the groups of human beings with which they are connected.
It will be considering them as part of the living
organism which the social units of man have created.
All this indicates a method of treating the subject
entirely different from what has hitherto obtained.
Students of early English institutions are content to
construct elaborate arguments from the often conflicting
testimony of historical authorities; students of early
beliefs construct elaborate systems of religious thought
far above the custom and rite with which they are dealing.
The two branches of the same subject are never
brought together to illustrate each other. Early institutions
cannot be separated from early beliefs. Early
beliefs cannot properly be separated from the society of
which they form a component part. We require to
know not only what beliefs a particular people possess,
but in what manner these beliefs generate custom and
rite and take their place among the influences which
affect the social organism. Early man does not live
individually. His life is part of a collective group.
The group worships collectively as it lives collectively,
and it is extremely important to work out the dual conditions.
If the several items of custom and belief preserved
by tradition are really ancient in their origin,
they must be floating fragments, as it were, of an
ancient <i>system</i> of custom and belief&mdash;the cultus of the
people among whom they originated. This cultus has
been destroyed, struggling unsuccessfully against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
foreign and more vigorous systems of religion and
society. To be of service to history each floating fragment
of ancient custom and belief must not only be
labelled "ancient," but it must be placed back in the
system from which it has been torn away. To do this
is to a great extent to restore the ancient system; and
to restore an ancient system of culture, even if the
restoration be only a mosaic and a shattered mosaic,
is to bring into evidence the people to which it
belongs.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter it was necessary to lay somewhat
special stress upon the system of social organisation
known as totemism, which was not founded upon
kinship. This was traced in survival among the pre-Celtic
peoples of Britain. If we now turn to the Celts
and Teutons of Britain we shall find that we have to
deal with a social organisation founded definitely upon
kinship; and if there are survivals of belief, custom, and
rite, derived from this kinship system, existing side by
side in the same culture area with survivals from the
kinless system, it will be necessary to explain how two
such opposite streams can have been kept flowing.</p>

<p>It is not difficult in the case of countries occupied by
Celtic or Teutonic peoples to ascertain what the particular
institution was which linked together the beliefs
of the people, though it is not easy to trace out all the
phases of it. It is the tribe&mdash;that system of society
which appears as the means by which Greek and
Roman, Celt and Teuton, Scandinavian and Slav,
Hindu and Persian, were able to conquer, overrun,
and finally to settle in the lands which they have
made their own. We know something of the Celtic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
tribe, less of the Teutonic tribe, but all we know is that
it possesses features in common with the tribe of its
kindred. There is no fact more certainly true as a
result of comparative research than that the tribe is the
common heritage of those people who have become the
dominant rulers of the Indo-European world. I use
this term "tribe" in no formal sense, not in the sense
of its Roman derivation and use, which shows it quite
as a secondary institution, but as the most convenient
term to define that grouping of men with wives, families,
and descendants, and all the essentials of independent
life, which is found as a primal unit of European
society in a state of unsettlement as regards land or
country. The tie which bound all together was personal
not local, kinship with a tribal god, kinship more
or less real with fellow-tribesmen, kinship in status and
rights. We meet with this tribal organisation everywhere
in Indo-European history. It made movement
from country to country possible. It made conquest
possible. Celt and Teuton did not conquer in families
any more than Greek or Hindu did. They conquered
in tribes, and it was because of the strength of the
tribal organisation during the period, first of migration
and wandering and then of conquest, that the settlement
after conquest was possible and was so strong.
Everywhere we find these people conquerors and settlers.
In India, in Iran, in Greece and Rome, in Scandinavia,
in Celtic and Teutonic Europe, in Slavic Europe, they
are moving tribes of conquerors come to settle and rule
the people they conquer.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> When Dr. Ridgeway asks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>

freedom were allowed to those who submitted and conformed
to the law of the conqueror; they might pass their lives as
servants on the farms of the Aryas (Manu, i. 91). But
though the remnant of this population was spared, the whole
body of the immigrants looked down on them with the pride
of conquerors&mdash;of superiority in arms, blood, and character&mdash;and
in contrast to them they called themselves Vai&ccedil;yas, i.e.
tribesmen, comrades, in other words those who belong to the
community or body of rulers. Whether the Vai&ccedil;ya belonged
to the order of the nobles, the minstrels and priests or
peasants, was a matter of indifference, he regarded the old
inhabitants as an inferior species of mankind.... In the
new states on the Ganges therefore the population was
separated into two sharply divided masses. How could the
conquerors mix with the conquered? How could their pride
stoop to any union with the despised servants?"<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p></div>

<p>These two divided masses thus so clearly described
were, in fact, tribesmen and non-tribesmen, just that distinction
which we meet with in Celtic and Teutonic law,
and described in the same terms which Bishop Stubbs
was obliged to use when he set forth the facts of the
Teutonic invasion of Britain.</p>

<p>The terms are indeed necessary terms. Tribesmen
capable of retaining the tribal organisation during the
period of migration and conquest did not lightly lose
that organisation when they settled. In Sir Alfred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
Lyall's pure genealogic clan of Central India<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> I
recognise the unbroken tribal formation before the
family group has arisen as a political unit. In Mr.
Tupper's argument against the conclusions of Sir
Henry Maine I recognise the Hindu evidence that the
tribe was the earliest social group, breaking up, as later
influences arose, into village communities and joint
families.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> In Bishop Stubbs's masterly analysis of
English constitutional history the tribe appears at the
outset&mdash;"the invaders," he says, "came in families
and kindreds and in the full organisation of their tribes
... the tribe was as complete when it had removed to
Kent as when it stayed in Jutland; the magistrate was
the ruler of the tribe not of the soil; the divisions were
those of the folk and the host not of the land; the laws
were the usage of the nation not of the territory."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
And so I agree with Mr. Skene as to the Celtic tribe
that "the tuath or tribe preceded the fine or clan,"<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
and with the editors of the Irish law tracts that "the
tribe existed before the family came into being and
continued to exist after the latter had been dissolved."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>We need not go beyond this evidence. The tribe is
the common form into which the early Indo-European
peoples grouped themselves for the purpose of conquest
and settlement. It was their primal unit. It may
have been numerically large or small. It may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
been the result of a combination of many smaller
tribes into one great tribe. But in any case and under
any conditions there stands out the tribal organisation,
that great institutional force from which spring all
later institutions. Its roots go back into the remotest
past of Indo-European history; its active force caused
the Indo-European people to become the mightiest in
human history; its lasting results have scarcely yet
ceased to shape the aspirations of political society and
to affect the destinies of nations. The whole life of the
early period was governed by tribal conditions&mdash;the
political, social, legal, and even religious conceptions
were tribal in form and expression.</p>

<p>The tribal institution of the Aryan-speaking peoples
includes a life outside the tribe. That was an outlaw's
life, a kinless outcast, whom no tribesman would look
upon or assist, whom every tribesman considered as an
enemy until he had reduced him to the position of helot
or slave, but for whom every tribe had a place in its
organisation and a legal status in its constitution. But
it was the legal status imposed by the master over the
servant, and the kinless included not only the outcast
from the tribe, but the conquered aboriginal who had
never been within the tribe. It is important to notice
this, for it to some extent measures the strength of the
tribal organisation. It not only allowed for a special
position for all tribesmen, but it allowed for that position
to have a definite relationship to persons who were
not tribesmen, and it is in the combined forces of
tribesmen and non-tribesmen that the tribal organisation
which swept over part of Asia and over all Europe
obtains its greatest power. There are tribal systems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span>
outside the Semitic and the Indo-European, but these
do not have the distinctive features that the tribal
systems of these two great civilising peoples possess.
Like the Semitic and Aryan tribal systems, savage
tribes are fashioned for conquest, but, unlike them,
they are not fashioned for settlement and resettlement,
and perhaps again and again conquest and resettlement.
They spent all their power, or most of
their power, in their one great effort of conquest, and
whether we turn to the American Indian tribes, to the
African tribes, or to the Asiatic tribes we find the same
facts of frequent dissipation of power after sudden and
complete conquest of it. The tribal system which led
to civilisation has a different history. It has, too, a
different constitution in that to the strength of tribesmen
was added the subordination&mdash;politically, industrially,
and economically&mdash;of non-tribesmen. They were
the people who, in the terms of the northern poem,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Laid fences,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enriched the plough lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tended swine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herded goats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dug peat."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately the institution of the tribe has never
been properly studied by the great authorities in history,
and students are left without guidance in this
important matter. And yet in any attempt to get back
to the earliest period of history in lands governed by
an Aryan-speaking people we must proceed, can only
proceed, on the basis of the tribe, and it is the failure to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
understand this which has made so much early history
unsatisfactory and inconclusive and compels us to the
conclusion that the master-hand is still needed to rewrite
in terms of tribal history all that has been written
in terms merely of political history.</p>

<p>If, however, history from the written records is thus
at fault, so too is history from the traditional records.
No systematic effort has been made to treat the traditional
story or the traditional custom and belief as part
of the tribal history of our race, and yet in the few
cases where it has been so treated the results are obviously
satisfactory. I can illustrate the value of this
point of view by an example drawn from the period
which witnessed the earliest struggles of our race. I
think with Mr. Keary that in those German stories
"which delight above all things in that portrait of the
youngest son of the house&mdash;he is the youngest of
three&mdash;who is left behind despised and neglected when
his brothers go forth to seek their fortunes," we have
traces of a veritable fact, of an historical condition
where the elder sons actually went forth to conquest
and to settlement and the youngest son remained in
the original home as the hearth-child.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> The position
of hearth-child, surviving as it does in our law of
Borough English, is of great significance, and that we
can by the aid of tradition reach a state of society
which gave birth to it is a point of the greatest importance,
even if we could go no further. But there is a
stage beyond it. The majority of these youngest-son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
stories relate to events not to be identified with any
particular tribe or people, but which belong to all the
tribes and peoples whose course of conquest and settlement
took the common form. But if apart from these
all-world stories there exist stories, or if there be but
one story which has become identified with an episode,
a person, or a place belonging to a particular people,
we may claim it as part of the history of that particular
people. It may be that the general story has become
specialised in this one case, or it may be that an entirely
new story has sprung out of the special case. But
whichever be the origin of such a story attached to a
particular people, it must tell us something of that
people at a period when its history was being made
rather than recorded. What it tells may be very little,
may not lead up to anything very great or definite, so
far as later history is concerned; but that for the period
to which it belongs it relates to an episode worthy to
have been kept in the memories of the descendants of
the chief actors in the events is the point to bear in
mind.</p>

<p>There is one such story which belongs to English
history. One of the most famous of these youngest-son
stories is that of Childe Rowland, and Mr. Jacobs,
on examining its incidents and details, suggests that
"our story may have a certain amount of historic basis
and give a record which history fails to give of the
very earliest conflict of races in these isles."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Mr.
Jacobs gives good grounds for this conclusion, and
shows up a picture of earliest English history which
is certainly not contained elsewhere, and we are able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
by this means to pass from that large group of youngest-son
stories, which have brought with them living
testimony of an ancient institution of our race in its
oldest home, to the narrower but more direct example
which comes to us from events which happened just at
the dawn of history in our own land. It is not necessary
to emphasise the importance of this service to
history at the instance of tradition, for it will be obvious
to every student that many a struggle must have remained
unrecorded and many a hero must have died
unnamed in the events which belong to the period of
tribal conquest and settlement. And to have still with
us the far-off echo of these events is no slight encouragement
to an inquiry which has for its object the
reconstruction of the conditions under which such
events took place.</p>

<p>This would be all the better understood if we could get
a concrete case for illustration, and, fortunately, this is
possible by turning to the evidence of India. "What
we know of the manner in which the states of Upper
India were founded," says Sir Alfred Lyall,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"gives a very fair sample of the movements and changes of
the primitive world. When the dominant Rajput families lost
their dominion in the rich Gangetic plains one part of their
clan seems to have remained in the conquered country,
having submitted to the foreigner, cultivating in strong
communities of villages and federations of villages and
paying such land tax as the ruler could extract. Another
part of the clan, probably the near kinsmen of the defeated
chief, followed his family into exile, and helped him to carve
out another, but a much poorer, dominion. Here the chief
built himself a fort upon the hill; his clansmen slew or
subdued the tribes they found in possession of the soil, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
the lands were all parcelled off among the chief's kinsfolk,
the indigenous proprietors being subjected to payment of
a land tax, but not otherwise degraded. When the land grew
too strait for the support of the chief's family or of the sept&mdash;that
is, when there were no vacant allotments, a landless son
of the chief would assemble a band, and set forth to make
room for himself elsewhere."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p></div>

<p>The evidence from India is fact, the evidence from
England is tradition, and yet I do not think any
student will deny that both fact and tradition are
part and parcel of the same conditions of society, the
same forces operating upon the same material. The
conditions of society in both cases are tribal conditions,
and the common factor having thus been discovered,
it is possible to determine not only the inter-relationship
between fact and tradition, but the means by which we
may estimate the value of both.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, stop here. I carry on the
same argument from the traditional legend to the
traditional custom and belief, and affirm that it is only
by their position as part of the tribal system that custom
and belief in survival must be tested. If they have descended
from early Celtic or Teutonic custom and belief,
they have descended from tribal custom and belief,
and somewhere in the stages of descent will be found the
link which connects them definitely with the tribe. That
not all custom and belief has so descended is due to the
fact that much of it belongs to the pre-Celtic period,
which was not tribal; some of it, no doubt, to comparatively
modern times, when, as we have already seen,
superstition had taken the place of thought, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
some phases of early belief belong to conditions which
transcend the division between pre-Aryan and Aryan
folk. On this I will say something by way of explanation
presently. In the meantime it is an extremely
important task to classify survivals into tribal and non-tribal
groups. Those which belong to Celtic or
Teutonic origins must show their tribal origin, for they
could not have come into existence apart from the tribe,
and apart from the tribe they could not have survived
after the break-up of the tribe consequent upon the
development of national and political life. Custom
and belief which do not fit into the ancient tribal
system, therefore, cannot be recognised as ancient
Celtic or ancient Teutonic custom and belief, and contrariwise
when it is seen that they naturally fall into
this system it may be argued that there we must search
for their origin. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers have
left a curious testimony to this view of the question in
their word "holy" or wholesome. What is wholesome
is so for the whole group. The Anglo-Saxon idea of
holiness implies as its chief element relation to the
tribal life.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The classification of survivals in folklore into tribal
and non-tribal items is a lengthy and intricate process.
Some years ago I made a start in a study of fire worship
which I presented to the British Association,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> and
I hope shortly to be ready with a volume on <i>Tribal
Custom</i>, which will embody a fuller study of fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
worship and its accompanying beliefs, together with
a complete study of all the remains of traditional
custom, rite, and belief, which only as the detritus
of the ancient tribal organisation receive adequate
explanation of their presence in the midst of modern
political and religious institutions. If I leave this
part of my subject without further illustration in
this present volume, I must add one important
note upon the persistence of survivals of both kinless
and kinship societies. I have shown that the tribal
system of the advanced races included provision
for non-tribesmen, provision which kept non-tribesmen
outside the tribal bond, and at the same time
kept them tied to the tribe by using them as the
necessary dependent adjunct of the tribe, using them
as bondmen and serfs in point of fact. This extremely
important factor in the history of the tribal
organisation, which has not been properly noticed by
the few authorities who have investigated tribal institutions,
receives additional importance when viewed from
the standpoint of folklore, for it allows for the preservation
of non-tribal cults side by side with tribal cults.
Non-tribesmen preserved their custom, belief, and rite
simply because they were not admitted to the custom,
belief, and rite of the tribe, and this is the explanation
of the existence, in survival, of folklore which goes
back to pre-Celtic times. Some of this pre-Celtic
folklore we have already had before us, and some
of it I have studied in my <i>Ethnology in Folklore</i>.
Later on I shall have something more to say on the
subject. Here it is only necessary to emphasise the
importance of having ascertained why it is that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span>
Celtic conquerors of Britain and the earliest tribal conquerors
of the Indo-European world generally permitted
to live in their midst what in a sense was
opposed to all that they believed, to all that they
practised, to all that governed them in thought and
action.</p>

<p>I think this is a strong position upon which to conduct
folklore research. It includes the whole of the historical
position; it takes due count of historical facts
instead of ignoring them. It is based upon a scientific
conception of the meaning of a survival of culture. A
survival is that which has been left stranded amidst
the development that is going on around. Its future
life is not one of development but of decay. We
are not dealing with the evolution of society, but
with the decaying fragments of a social system which
has passed away. We have to trace out its line of
decay from the point where it almost vanishes as the
mere superstition or practice of a peasant or an outcast,
back to phases where it exists in more strenuous
fashion, and finally back to its original position as
part and parcel of a living social fabric. Moreover,
the strength of our position is based upon a scientific
conception of the development of the nation or people
among whom survivals exist. It is not all parts of the
nation which develop at the same rate, at the same time,
and for the same period. There are social strata in
every country, and it is the observance of these strata
which has made it possible for the inquirer of to-day to
use the evidence they afford for historical purposes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>EUROPEAN CONDITIONS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>here are obviously conditions attaching to
European culture history which do not apply
elsewhere, and as obviously the most important,
perhaps the only important one, which it is necessary
to consider in connection with the problems of folklore
is that resulting from the introduction of a non-European
religion and the adoption of this religion as part
of the state machinery in the several countries. This
religion is, of course, Christianity. It came into the
home of a decaying, corrupt, and impossible state
religion wherever the Roman Empire was established
and into the homes of purer and sterner faiths, faiths
that had belonged to the people through all the years
of conquest and settlement, migration and resettlement,
wherever the empire of Rome had not become
established.</p>

<p>Until the advent of Christianity into Britain the
Celtic peoples possessed their own customs, their own
religious beliefs, their own usages. Until the Anglo-Saxons
came into contact with Christianity in their
new settlements in England, they also possessed their
own customs, usages, and beliefs. So far as Celt and
Teuton were responsible for continuing or allowing to
continue the still older faiths, the faiths of savagery as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
we have accustomed ourselves to term them, they
brought these faiths also into contact with Christianity,
and Christianity dealt with the problem thus presented
exactly as it dealt with the Celtic and Teutonic faiths,
namely, by treating all alike as pagan, all equally to
be set aside or used in any fashion that circumstances
might demand. Let it be particularly noted that
Christianity did not distinguish between the various
shades of paganism. All that was not Christian was
pagan.</p>

<p>Christianity was both antagonistic to and tolerant
of pagan custom and belief. In principle and purpose
it was antagonistic. In practice it was tolerant
where it could tolerate safely. At the centre it aimed
at purity of Christian doctrine, locally it permitted
pagan practices to be continued under Christian auspices.
In the earliest days it set itself against all
forms of idolatry and non-Christian practices; in later
days, after the fifth century, says Gibbon,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> it accepted
both pagan practice and pagan ritual.</p>

<p>The relationship of Christianity to paganism is,
therefore, a very complex subject, and it would not be
possible in this place to work out one tithe of it. Nor
is it needed. The two cardinal facts with which we are
now concerned are the principle of antagonism and the
practice of toleration. As to the former there need not
be any discussion on the fact. Everywhere throughout
Europe its effect is to be seen. It formed the most
solid and systematic arresting force against the natural
development of pagan belief and practice, and it is
this fact of arrested development in pagan belief and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
practice which is of great importance. We can ascertain
the point of stoppage, note the stage of arrested
development, and trace out the subsequent history of a
custom, belief, or rite so arrested. As a survival in a
state of arrested development, a custom or belief is
observable throughout its later history. All it does is
to decay, and decay slowly, and each stage of decay
may oftentimes be discovered. On the other hand, if
no arrest of development had taken place there would
have been no survival and no decay. The custom or
belief which is not arrested by an opposing culture
becomes a part of the religion or of the institutions of
the nation, and the history of its development becomes,
as a rule, lost in the general advance of religion and
politics&mdash;custom develops into law, belief develops into
religion, rite develops into ceremonial, and tradition
ceases to be the force which keeps them alive. The
two classes of custom and belief thus contrasted are of
different value to the student. The one is important
because it contains the germs and goes back to the
origin of existing institutions. The other is important
because, having been arrested by a strong opposing
force, unable to destroy it altogether, it remains as
evidence of custom and belief at the time of its arrestment.
It will be seen at once how far this evidence
may take us. It stretches back into the remotest past.
It survives in the stage at which it was arrested, not of
course in the form in which it then appeared, but in the
decayed form which years of existence beneath the
ever-opposing forces of the established civilisation
must have brought about.</p>

<p>These opposing forces can be detected in working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
order. What can be more indicative of a dual system
of belief than the cry of an old Scottish peasant when
he came to worship at the sacred well?&mdash;"O Lord, Thou
knowest that well would it be for me this day an I had
stoopit my knees and my heart before Thee in spirit and
in truth as often as I have stoopit them afore this well.
But we maun keep the customs of our fathers." It
appears over and over again in the lives of early Christian
saints who were only just parting from a living
pagan faith. Thus St. Bega was the patroness of
St. Bees in Cumberland, where she left a holy bracelet
which was long an object of profound veneration; and
in a prefatory statement by the compiler of a small
collection of her miracles, written in the twelfth
century, we learn among other things that whosoever
forswore himself upon her bracelet swiftly incurred
the heaviest punishment of perjury or a speedy death.
It is to be observed that Beagas, the French Bague,
is the Anglo-Saxon denomination for rings, and
Dr. William Bell suggests that holy St. Bega was but
a personification of one of the holy rings which, having
gained great hold upon the minds of the heathen
Cumbrians, it was not politic in their first Christian
missionaries wholly to subvert.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> These rings are, of
course, the doom rings of the Scandinavian temples
which are so often referred to in the Sagas.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>Baptism, an essentially Christian ceremony, might
off-hand be supposed to contain nothing but evidence
for Christianity. It might at most be expected that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>
details of the ceremony would contain relics of adapted
pagan rites, and this we know is the case. But we can
go beyond even this, and discover in the popular
conception of the rite very clear indications of the
early antagonism between Christianity and paganism&mdash;an
antagonism which is certainly some eighteen hundred
years old in this country, and though so old is still
contained in the evidence of folklore.</p>

<p>An analysis of baptismal folklore shows us that
its most important section is contained under the
group which deals with the effect of non-baptism.
In England we have it prevailing in the border
counties, in Cornwall, Devonshire, Durham, Lancashire,
Middlesex, Northumberland, and Yorkshire, and
in North-East Scotland, that children joined the ranks
of the fairies if they died unchristened, or that their
souls wandered about in the air, restless and unhappy,
until Judgment Day. Various penalties attended the
condition of non-baptism, but perhaps the most significant
is the Northumberland custom of burying an
unbaptised babe at the feet of an adult Christian corpse&mdash;surely
a relic of the old sacrifice at a burial which is
indicated so frequently in the graves of prehistoric
times, particularly of the long-barrow period. In
Ireland we have the effect of non-baptism in a still
more grim form. In the sixteenth century the rude
Irish used to leave the right arms of their male children
unchristened, to the intent that they might give a more
ungracious and deadly blow.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>These, and their allied and variant customs, are
relics, not so much of the absorption by Christian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg&nbsp;325]</a></span>baptism of rites belonging to early paganism as of the
struggle between Christianity and paganism for the
mastery, of the anathemas of Christians against pagans,
and of the terrible answer of the pagan. And what are
we to say to it? Is it that the struggle itself has lasted
all these centuries, or only its memory? My belief is
that the struggle itself has lasted in reality though not
in name.</p>

<p>But if we have been able to look through the very
portals of Christianity to the regions of paganism behind,
can we not boldly pass through altogether and
recover from folklore much of the lost evidence of our
prehistoric ancestors? I put the question in this way
purposely, because it is the way which is indicated by
the methods and data of folklore, and it is a question
which has much to do with the different views held of
the province of folklore.</p>

<p>I will answer by referring to the pre-baptismal rites
of washing. In Northumberland we meet with the
analogue of the sixteenth-century Irish practice, for
there the child's right hand is left unwashed that it may
gather riches better<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>&mdash;the golden coin taking the place
of the ancient weapon in this as in other phases of civilisation.
Not only is the water used for this purpose
heated in the old-fashioned way by placing red-hot irons
in it (<i>i.e.</i> the modern equivalent for stone-boiling), but
in Yorkshire we have the custom that the newborn
infant must be placed in the arms of a maiden before
any one else touches it, two practices represented exactly
in the customs of the Canary Islanders, who were in
the stone age of culture and are considered to be the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
remnants of a race which once included Britain among
its lands of occupation.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. C. O'Connor, in his third letter of Columbanus,
gives a very interesting statement of Irish well-worship
in a letter addressed to his brother, the late
Owen O'Connor Don, and which shows the living
antagonism between Christian and pagan belief. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have often enquired of your tenants what they themselves
thought of their pilgrimage to their wells of Kill
Orcht, Tobbar-Brighde, Tobbar-Muire, near Elphin, and
Moore, near Castlereagh, where multitudes assemble annually
to celebrate what they, in broken English, termed
Patterns; and when I pressed a very old man&mdash;Owen Hester&mdash;to
state what possible advantage he expected to derive
from the singular custom of frequenting in particular such
wells as were contiguous to an old blasted oak, or an upright
unhewn stone, and what the meaning was of the yet more
singular custom of sticking rags in the branches of such
trees and spitting on them, his answer, and the answer of
the oldest men, was that their ancestors always did it;
that it was a preservative against Geasa-Dravideacht, <i>i.e.</i> the
sorceries of Druids; that their cattle was preserved by it
from infectious disorders; that the davini maithe, <i>i.e.</i> the
fairies, were kept in good humour by it; and so thoroughly
persuaded were they of the sanctity of these pagan practices
that they would travel bareheaded and barefooted from ten
to twenty miles for the purpose of crawling on their knees
round these wells and upright stones and oak trees westward
as the sun travels, some three times, some six, some
nine, and so on, in uneven numbers until their voluntary
penances were completely fulfilled. The waters of Logh-Con
were deemed so sacred from ancient usage that they
would throw into the lake whole rolls of butter as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
preservation for the milk of their cows against Geasa-Dravideacht."<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p></div>

<p>Scarcely less important than the effect of the antagonism
of the Church in the production of arrested
development is the effect of the toleration of the Church
for pagan custom and belief. This toleration took the
shape either of allowing the continuation of pagan
custom and belief as a matter not affecting Christian
doctrine or of actual absorption into Church practice
and ritual. The story told to the full is a long and
interesting one. And it still awaits the telling.
Gibbon, in a few sentences, has told us the outline.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
Other authorities have told us small episodes. I am,
of course, not concerned here with anything more than
to adduce sufficient evidence to establish the fact that
Christian tolerance of paganism has been one of the
assistant causes for the long continuance of pagan survivals.</p>

<p>I shall not hesitate to begin by quoting at length a
luminous passage from Grimm's great work. In the
preface to his second edition he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Oftentimes the Church prudently permitted, or could not
prevent, that heathen and Christian things should here and
there run into one another; the clergy themselves would not
always succeed in marking off the bounds of the two religions:
their private leanings might let some things pass which
they found firmly rooted in the multitude. In the language,
together with a stock of newly-imported Greek and Latin
terms, there still remained, even for ecclesiastical use, a
number of Teutonic words previously employed in heathen
services, just as the names of gods stood ineradicable in the
days of the week; to such words old customs would still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
cling silent and unnoticed and take a new lease of life. The
festivals of the people present a tough material: they are so
closely bound up with its habits of life that they will put up
with foreign additions if only to save a fragment of festivities
long loved and tried. In this way Scandinavia, probably
the Goths also for a time, and the Anglo-Saxons down
to a late period, retained the heathenish Yule as all Teutonic
Christians did the sanctity of Easter-tide; and from these
two the Yule-boar and Yule-bread, the Easter pancake,
Easter-sword, Easter-fire, and Easter-dance could not be
separated. As faithfully were perpetuated the name and in
many cases the observances of Midsummer. New Christian
feasts, especially of saints, seem purposely, as well as accidentally,
to have been made to fall on heathen holidays.
Churches often rose precisely where a heathen god or his
sacred tree had been pulled down, and the people trod their
old paths to the accustomed site; sometimes the very walls
of the heathen temple became those of the church, and cases
occur in which idol images still found a place in a wall of the
porch, or were set up outside the door, as at Bamberg
Cathedral there lie Slavic heathen figures of animals inscribed
with runes. Sacred hills and fountains were rechristened
after saints, to whom their sanctity was transferred;
sacred woods were handed over to the newly-founded
convent or the king, and even under private ownership did
not lose their long-accustomed homage. Law usages, particularly
the ordeals and oath-takings, but also the beating
of bounds, consecrations, image processions, spells and formulas,
while retaining their heathen character, were simply
clothed in Christian forms. In some customs there was
little to change: the heathen practice of sprinkling a newborn
babe with water closely resembled Christian baptism;
the sign of the hammer, that of the cross; and the erection
of tree crosses the irmens&ucirc;ls and world trees of paganism."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
This passage, written in 1844, has been abundantly
illustrated by the research of specialists since that date,
and, of course, Mr. Frazer's monumental work will
occur to every reader. But, after all, the chief authority
for the action of the Church towards paganism in this
country is the famous letter of Pope Gregory to the
Abbot Mellitus in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 601, as preserved by the historian
Beda. It is worth while quoting this once
again, for it is an English historical document of
priceless value. "We have been much concerned,"
writes the good St. Gregory,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"since the departure of our congregation that is with you,
because we have received no account of the success of your
journey. When, therefore, Almighty God shall bring you to
the most reverend Bishop Augustine our brother, tell him
what I have, upon mature deliberation on the affair of the
English, determined upon, namely, that the temples of the
idols [fana idolorum] in that nation [gente] ought not to be
destroyed; but let the idols that are in them be destroyed; let
holy water be made and sprinkled upon the said temples, let
altars be erected and relics placed. For if these temples be
well built, it is requisite that they be converted from the
worship of devils [d&aelig;monum] to the worship of the true God;
that the nation seeing that their temples are not destroyed may
remove error from their hearts, and knowing and adoring the
true God may the more familiarly resort to the places to which
they have been accustomed. And because they have been
used to slaughter many oxen in the sacrifices to devils some
solemnity must be exchanged for them on this account, so
that on the day of the dedication, or the nativities of the
holy martyrs whose relics are there deposited, they may
build themselves huts of the boughs of trees, about those
churches which have been turned to that use from temples
and celebrate the solemnity with religious feasting and no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg&nbsp;330]</a></span>
more offer beasts to the devil [diabolo], but kill cattle to the
praise of God in their eating, and return thanks to the giver
of all things for their sustenance."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p></div>

<p>The church of St. Pancras at Canterbury is claimed
to be one of the temples so preserved,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and there have
survived down to our own times examples of the
animal sacrifice which in early Christian days may
well have been preserved by this famous edict.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> But
beyond these illustrations of the two stated objects
of Pope Gregory's letter there are innumerable additional
results from such a policy,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> results which prove
that British pagandom was not stamped out by edict
or by sword, but was rather gradually borne down
before the strength of the new religion&mdash;borne down
and pushed into the background out of sight of the
Church and the State, relegated to the cottage homes,
the cattle-sheds and the cornfields, the countryside and
the denizens thereof.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
This is where we must search for it, and I think this
important element in our studies will be better understood
if we turn for one moment to the results of
Christian contact with earlier belief in the one country
where Christianity has set up its strongest political force,
namely, Italy. Dr. Middleton wrote a series of remarkable
letters which tell us much on this point, but
before referring to this, I wish first to quote a hitherto
buried record by an impartial observer<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> in the year
1704. It is a letter written from Venice to Sir Thomas
Frankland, describing the travels and observations of
a journey into Italy. The traveller writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I cannot leave Itally without making some general observations
upon the country in general, and first as to their
religion; it differs in name only now from what it was in the
time of the ancient heathen Romans. I know this will
sound very oddly with some sort of people, but compare
them together and then let any reasonable man judge of the
difference. The heathen Itallians had their gods for peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
and for war, for plenty and poverty, for health and sickness,
riches and poverty, to whom they addressed themselves and
their wants; and the Christian Itallians have their patron
saints for each of these things, to whom they also address
according to their wants. The heathen sacrificed bulls and
other beasts, and the Christian ones after the same manner
a piece of bread, which a picture in the garden of Aldobrandina
at Rome, painted in the time of Titus Vespasian,
shews by the altar and the priests' vestments to have been
the same as used now. The Pantheon at Rome was dedicated
by the ancients to all the gods, and by the moderns to
all the saints; the temple of Castor and Pollux at Rome is
now dedicated to Cosmo and Damian, also twin brothers.
The respect they pay to the Virgin Mary is far greater than
what they pay to the Son, and whatever English Roman
Catholics may be made to believe by their priests or impose
upon us, it is certain that the devotion to the Madonnas in
Itally is something more than a bare representation of the
Virgin Mary when they desire her intercession. Miracles
they pretend not only to be wrought by the Madonnas themselves,
but there is far greater respect paid to a Madonna in
one place than another, whereas if this statue were only a
bare representation of the Virgin to keep them in mind of
her, the respect would be equal. I visited all the famous
ones, and it would fill a volume to tell you the fopperies
that's said of them. That of Loretto, being what they say
is the very house where the Virgin lived, is not to be
described, the riches are so great, nor the devotion that's
paid to the statue.... The Lady of Saronna is another
famous one and very rich; she is much handsomer than she
of Loretto and a whole church-full of the legend of the
miracles she hath wrought. She is in great reputation, and
it's thought will at last outtop the Lady of Loretto; there is
another near Leghorne that I also visited called <i>La Madonna
della Silva Nera</i>, to whom all Itallian ships that enter that
port make a present of thanks for their happy voyage, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg&nbsp;333]</a></span>
salute her with their cannon, and most ships going out give
her something for her protection during their voyage. I
could tire you with she at the Annunciata at Florence, she
within a mile of Bollognia, for whom the magistracy have
piazza'd the road all the way from her station to the city,
that she may not be encumbered with sun or rain when she
makes them a visit, and hundreds more that would fill a
volume of fopperies that I had the curiosity to see, but it
would be imposing too much upon your patience."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p></div>

<p>This only confirms Dr. Middleton's conclusions,
which received the approval of Gibbon, and those of
later writers. "As I descended from the Alps," writes
the Rev. W.&nbsp;H. Blunt in 1823,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was admonished of my entrance into Italy by a little
chapel to the Madonna, built upon a rock by the roadside,
and from that time till I repassed this chain of
mountains I received almost hourly proof that I was wandering
amongst the descendants of that people which is
described by Cicero to have been the most religious of mankind.
Though the mixture of religion with all the common
events of life is anything but an error, yet I could not avoid
regretting that, like their heathen ancestors, the modern
Italians had supplied the place of our great master mover by
a countless host of inferior agents."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Blunt goes on to give interesting details of the
close connection between the modern religious festival,
ceremony, or service, and those of classical times, and
the conclusion is obvious. In modern days Dr.
Mommsen has lent the sanction of his great authority
to the identification of the birthday of Christ with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg&nbsp;334]</a></span>
that of Mithra,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and Mr. Leland has given such
numerous identifications not only of the cults of pagan
and Christian Italy, but of the god-names of ancient
Rome with the saint-names or witch-names of modern
times,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> that it seems impossible to deny a place for this
evidence. "It was," says Gibbon,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"the universal sentiment both of the Church and of heretics
that the d&aelig;mons were the authors, the patrons, and the objects
of idolatry; those rebellious spirits who had been degraded
from the rank of angels were still permitted to roam upon
earth, to torment the bodies and to seduce the minds of sinful
men. It was confessed, or at least it was imagined, that they
had distributed among themselves the most important characters
of Polytheism, one d&aelig;mon assuming the name of Jupiter,
another of &AElig;sculapius, a third of Venus, and a fourth
perhaps of Apollo."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p></div>

<p>This, then, is recognition and adoption of pagan beliefs,
not the uprooting of them. If the Roman Jupiter
was a Christian d&aelig;mon, his existence at all events was
recognised. But even this negative way of adopting the
old beliefs gave way as the Church spread further. The
tribe of d&aelig;mons soon included the popular fairy, elf,
and goblin. And then came the positive adoption of
pagan customs. Gibbon describes how the early
Christians refused to decorate their doors with garlands
and lamps, and to take part in the ceremonial of lifting
the bride over the threshold of the house.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Both
these customs have survived in popular folklore, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span>
spite of the recorded action of the early Church, and
it would be curious to ascertain whether they have
survived by the help of the Church. We cannot
answer that question of historical evidence just now,
but it is a question which, in its wider aspect, as
including many other items of folklore, ought to be
examined into. There is no doubt, however, that by
analogy it can be answered, because we have ample
evidence, if the writings of reformers may be taken as
historical facts and not polemical imaginations, that
many very important customs, among the richest as
well as the poorest treasures of folklore, have been, so
to speak, Christianised by the Church, and that
the Church has taken part in and adopted non-Christian
customs, the survivors of olden-time life
in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>Now it is clear from these considerations, and from
the vast mass of information which is gradually being
accumulated on the subject, that not only the arresting
force of Christianity but also its toleration has assisted
in the preservation of pre-Christian belief and custom.
But the preservation has been in fragments only. The
system which supported the older faith and might, if it
had been allowed a natural growth, have produced
a newer religion of its own, was completely shattered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span>
It left no preservative force except that of tradition, the
traditional instinct to do what has always been done, to
believe what has always been believed. Pre-Christian
belief and custom has thus become isolated beliefs and
customs in survival. It has been broken up into innumerable
fragments of unequal character, and containing
unequal elements. It has been forced back
into secret action wherever Christianity was wholly
antagonistic, and hence primitive public worship has
tended to become local worship, or household worship,
or even personal worship, while all such worship which
is not the authorised Church worship has tended to become
superstition. Where Christianity was not wholly
antagonistic, it absorbed rites, customs, and even beliefs,
and these primitive survivals have taken their
place in the evolution of Christian doctrine, and thus
become lost to the students of Celtic and Teutonic
antiquities. But even so, there are discoverable points
where the dividing line between non-Christian and
Christian belief has not been obliterated by the process
of absorption. In all cases it is the duty of the student
to note the stage of arrested development in the primitive
rite, custom, or belief, whether it be caused by
antagonism or by absorption. It is at this point,
indeed, that the history of the survival begins. It
is here that we have to turn from the polity, the
religion, or cultus of a people to the belief, practices,
or superstition of that portion of our nation which
has not shared its progress from tribesmen to citizens,
from paganism to Christianity, from vain imaginings
to science and philosophy. It is from this point we
have to turn from the dignity of courts, the doings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg&nbsp;337]</a></span>
of armies, and the results of commerce, to the doings,
sayings, and ideas of the peasantry who cannot read,
and who have depended upon tradition for all, or
almost all, they know outside the formalities of law
and Church.</p>

English to retain their old temples and accustomed rites, attaching,
however, to them another purpose and a new meaning, so his
successors found means to utilize the simple beliefs of early animism.
Long and vainly the Church struggled against this irresistible sentiment.
Fifteen centuries ago it was charged against the Christians of that day
that they appeased the shades of the dead with feasts like the Gentiles.
In the Penitentials we find the prohibition of burning grains where a man
had died. In the <i>Indiculus superstitionum et Paganiarum</i> among the
Saxons complaint is made of the too ready canonisation of the dead;
and the Church seems to have been much troubled to keep within
reasonable bounds this tendency to indiscriminate apotheosis. At length
a compromise was effected, and the Feast of All Souls converted to
pious uses that wealth of sentiment which previously was lavished on
the dead" (<i>The Aryan Household</i>, p. 60). And, to close this short note
upon an important subject, Mr. Metcalfe, speaking of the old poetic
literature of the pagan English, says: "It was kidnapped, and its
features so altered and disguised as not to be recognisable. It was supplanted
by Christian poetical legends and Bible lays produced in rivalry
of the popular lays of their heathen predecessors. Finding that the
people would listen to nothing but these old lays, the missionaries
affected their spirit and language, and borrowed the words and phrases
of heathenism" (Metcalfe's <i>Englishman and Scandinavian</i>, p. 155).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>ETHNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>lready I have had to point out that an
appeal to ethnological evidence is the means
of avoiding the wholesale rejection of custom
and belief recorded of early Britain, because it has
been rejected as appertaining to the historic Celt. I
will now proceed with the definite proposition that the
survivals in folklore may be allocated and explained by
their ethnological bearing.</p>

<p>Some years ago I advanced this proposition in my
little book entitled <i>Ethnology in Folklore</i>. Only haltingly
have my conclusions been accepted, but I nowhere
find them disproved,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> while here and there I find
good authorities appealing to the ethnological element
in folklore to help them in their views. Mr. MacCulloch,
for instance, prefers to go for the basis of the Osiris
and Dionysius myths to an earlier custom than that
favoured by Mr. Frazer and Mr. Grant Allen, namely,
to the practices of the neolithic folk, in Egypt and over
a wide tract of country which includes Britain, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg&nbsp;339]</a></span>
dismembering the dead body previous to its burial.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Mr.
Lang, Mr. Frazer, Mr. Hartland, and others are
strangely reticent on this subject. That Mr. Lang
should be content to trace a story from the Vedas, in
which Urvasi tells Pururavas that he must never let
her see him naked, to "a traditional Aryan law of
nuptial etiquette,"<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> seems to be using the heaviest
machinery for the smallest purposes, while for other
and greater purposes he fails to find in ethnological
distinctions, explanations which escape his research.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
That Mr. Frazer should have been able to examine in so
remarkable a manner the agricultural rites of European
peoples, and only to have touched upon their ethnological
bearings in one or two isolated cases, seems to
me to be neglecting one of the obvious means of
arriving at the solution of the problem he starts out
to solve.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>I do not want to discount these fragmentary appeals
to the ethnological element in folklore. I accept them
as evidence that the appeal has to be made. I would
only urge that it may be done on more thorough lines,
after due consideration of all the elements of the proposition
and of all that it means to the study of folklore.
We cannot surrender to the pal&aelig;ontologist all
that folklore contains in tradition and in custom as to
pygmy peoples, or to the Egyptologist all that it contains
as to dismemberment burial rites, without at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg&nbsp;340]</a></span>
same time realising that if it is correct to refer these
two groups of folklore respectively to the earliest ages
of man's existence as man and to the neolithic stage of
culture, they must be withdrawn from all other classification.
We cannot use the same items of folklore in
two totally different ways. The results of withdrawal
are as important as the results of allocation, and the
necessity for the correct docketing of all groups of folklore
is thus at once illustrated.</p>

<p>The first point in the argument for ethnological data
being discoverable in folklore is that a survey of the
survivals of custom, belief, and rites in any given
country shows one marked feature, which results in a
dividing line being drawn as between two distinct
classes. This feature is the antagonism which is discoverable
in these classes. On one side of the dividing
line is a set of customs, beliefs, and rites which
may be grouped together because they are consistent
with each other, and on the other side is another set
of customs, beliefs, and rites which may be grouped
together on the same ground. But between these
two sets of survivals there is no agreement. They
are the negations of each other. They show absolutely
different conceptions of all the phases of life
and thought which they represent, and it is impossible
to consider that they have both come from the same
culture source. I have applied the test of ethnology
to such cases in Britain, and this appears to answer the
difficulty which their antagonism presents. It appears
too to be the only answer.</p>

<p>The subjects which show this antagonism are all of
vital importance. They include friendly and inimical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg&nbsp;341]</a></span>
relations with the dead; marriage as a sacred tribal
rite and marriage as a rule of polyandrous society;
birth ceremonies which tell of admittance into a sacred
circle of kinsmen, and birth ceremonies which breathe
of revenge and hostility; the reverential treatment of
the aged folk and the killing of them off; the preservation
of human life as part of the tribal blood, and
human sacrifice as a certain cure for all personal evils;
the worship of waters as a strongly localised cult, preserved
because it is local by whatsoever race or people
are in occupation and in successive occupation of the
locality; totemic beliefs connected with animals and
plants contrasted with ideas entirely unconnected with
totemism&mdash;all this, and much more which has yet to be
collected and classified, reveals two distinct streams of
thought which cannot by any process be taken back to
one original source.</p>

<p>This fact of definite antagonism between different
sets of surviving beliefs existing together in one
country leads to several very important conclusions.
This is the case with the Irish Sids. These beings
are said to be scattered over Ireland, and around
them assembled for worship the family or clan of the
deified patron. While there were thus a number of
topical deities, each in a particular spot where he was
to be invoked, the deities themselves with the rest of
their non-deified but blessed brother spirits had as
their special abode "Lands of the Living," the happy
island or islands somewhere far away in the ocean.
Now this Sid worship, we are told by Irish scholars,
"had nothing to do with Druidism&mdash;in fact, was quite
opposed to it," the Sids and the Druids being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg&nbsp;342]</a></span>
"frequently found at variance with each other in respect to
mortals."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>This is the commencing point of the evidence which
proves Druidism to have belonged to the pre-Celtic
people, though finding an adopted home among them.
This is so important a subject and has been so strangely
and inconsistently dealt with by most authorities that it
will be well to indicate where we have to search for the
non-Celtic, and therefore pre-Celtic, origin of Druidism.
The Druidism revealed by classical authorities is, for
the most part, the Druidism of continental peoples and
not of Britain, and I hesitate to accept off-hand that it
is proper to transfer the continental system to Britain
and say that the two systems were one and the same.
There is certainly no evidence from the British side
which would justify such a course, and I think there is
sufficient argument against it to suspend judgment
until the whole subject is before us. If Professor
Rhys is right in concluding that Druidism is at its
roots a non-Celtic religion,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> we must add to this that
it was undoubtedly a non-Teutonic religion. Celts
and Teutons were sufficiently near in all the elements
of their civilisation for this want of parallel in their
relationship to Druidism to be an additional argument
against the Celts having originated this cult. And
then the explanation of the differences between continental
and British Druidism becomes comparatively
easy to understand. The continental Celts, mixing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg&nbsp;343]</a></span>
more thoroughly with the pre-Celtic aborigines than
did the British Celts, would have absorbed more of the
pre-Celtic religion than the British Celts, and hence all
the details which classical authorities have left us of continental
Druidism appear as part of the Celtic religion,
while in Britain these details are for the most part absent.
But this is not all. There are certain rites in Britain
noted by the early authorities which are not attached to
any particular cult. They are not Druidic; they are
not Celtic. They are, as a matter of fact, special examples
of rites practised in only one locality, and
accordingly referred to as something extraordinary and
not general. From this it is clearly correct to argue
that the British Celts had in their midst a cult which,
if they did not destroy, they certainly did not absorb,
and that therefore this cult being non-Celtic must have
been pre-Celtic.</p>

<p>I do not wish to argue this point out further than is
necessary to explain the position which, it appears to
me, Druidism occupies, and I will therefore only add
a note as to the authorities for the statements I have
advanced. The differences between continental and
British Druidism are definite and pronounced,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg&nbsp;344]</a></span>
mixture of the continental Celts with the Iberic people,
which they displaced, is attested, by ancient authority
and modern anthropology,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> while the only evidence of
such a mixture in Britain is the prominently recorded
instance of the Picts intermarrying with the Gael,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> and
this has to be set against the close distinction between
tribesmen and non-tribesmen, which is such a remarkable
feature of Celtic law;<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> the existence of local
cults in early Britain having all the characteristics of
a ruder and more savage origin, and not identified
with Celticism, is a point derived from our early
authorities.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> These are the main facts of the case,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg&nbsp;345]</a></span>
and the subject has to be worked out in considerable
detail before it can be settled.</p>

<p>There is one other primary subject which bears upon
the question of race distinctions in folklore. With the
fact of conquest to reckon with, the relationship of the
conqueror to the conquered is a matter to consider. In
the European tribal system it was a definite relationship,
so definite that the conquered, as we have seen,
formed an essential part of the tribal organisation&mdash;the
kinless slaves beneath the tribal kindred. There was a
place for the kinless in the tribal economy and in the
tribal laws. There was also a place for them in the
tribal system of belief, and the mythic influence of the
conquered is a subject that needs very careful consideration.</p>

<p>It is an influence which appears in all parts of the
world. Thus, to give a few instances, in New Guinea
they have no idols, and apparently no idea of a
supreme being or a good spirit. Their only religious
ideas consist in a belief in evil spirits. They live a
life of slavish fear to these, but seem to have no
idea of propitiating them by sacrifice or prayer. They
believe in the deathlessness of the soul. A death in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg&nbsp;346]</a></span>
the village is the occasion of bringing plenty of ghosts
to escort their new companion, and perhaps fetch some
one else. All night the friends of the deceased sit up
and keep the drums going to drive away the spirits;
they strike the fences and posts of houses all through
the village with sticks. This is done to drive back the
spirits to their own quarters on the adjacent mountain
tops. But it is the spirits of the inland tribes, the
aborigines of the country, that the coast tribes most
fear. They believe, when the natives are in the neighbourhood,
that the whole plain is full of spirits who
come with them. All calamities are attributed to the
power and malice of these evil spirits. Drought,
famine, storm and flood, disease and death are all
supposed to be brought by Vata and his hosts, so that
the people are an easy prey to any designing individuals
who claim power over these. Some disease charmers
and rain-makers levy heavy toll on the people.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>It appears that the native population of New Zealand
was originally composed of two different races, which
have retained some of their characteristic features,
although in course of time they have in all other
respects become mixed, and a number of intermediate
varieties have thence resulted. From the existence of
two races in New Zealand the conclusion might be
drawn that the darker were the original proprietors of
the soil anterior to the arrival of a stock of true Polynesian
origin, that they were conquered by the latter
and nearly exterminated. There is a district in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg&nbsp;347]</a></span>
northern island, situated between Taupo and Hawke's
Bay, called Urewera, consisting of steep and barren
hills. The scattered inhabitants of this region have
the renown of being the greatest witches in the country.
They are very much feared, and have little connection
with the neighbouring tribes, who avoid them if
possible. If they come to the coast the natives there
scarcely venture to refuse them anything for fear of
incurring their displeasure. They are said to use the
saliva of the people whom they intend to bewitch, and
visitors carefully conceal their spittle to give them no
opportunity of working their evil. Like our witches
and sorcerers of old, they appear to be a very harmless
people, and but little mixed up with the quarrels of
their neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The Australians, according to
Oldfield, ascribe spirit powers to those residing north
of themselves and hold them in great dread.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>In Asia the same idea prevails among the native
races. Thus Colquhoun says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"it was amusing to find the dread in which the Lawas [a
hill tribe] are held by both Burmese and Siamese. This is
due to a fear of being bitten by them and dying of the bite.
They are called by their Burmese neighbours the 'man-bears.'
A singular custom obtains amongst these people
which may perhaps partly account for this superstition. On
a certain night in the year the youths and maidens meet
together for the purpose of pairing. Unacceptable youths
are said to be bitten severely if they make advances to the
ladies."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg&nbsp;348]</a></span>
The Semang pygmy people, afraid to approach
the Malays even for purposes of barter, "learnt
to work upon the superstition of the Malays by presenting
them with medicines which they pretended
to derive from particular shrubs and trees in the
woods."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> That this is a real superstition of the conquerors
for the conquered is proved from other sources
to which I have referred elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>In Africa it appears as a living force, and we are told
that the stories current in the country of the Ukerew&eacute;,
"about the witchcraft practised by the people of Ukara
island, prove that those islanders have been at pains to
spread abroad a good repute for themselves; that they
are cunning, and aware that superstition is a weakness
of human nature have sought to thrive upon it."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>It appears in more definite form with the Hindus.
The Kathkuri, or Katodi, have a belief that they are
descended from the monkeys and bears which Adi
Narayun in his tenth incarnation of Rama, took with
him for the destruction of Rawun, King of Lanka, and
he promised his allies that in the fourth age they should
become human beings. They practise incantation, and
encourage the awe with which the Hindu regards their
imprecations, for a Hindu believes that a Katodi can
transform himself into a tiger.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg&nbsp;349]</a></span>
To this day the Aryans settled in Chota-Nagpore and
Singbhoom firmly believe that the Moondahs have
powers as wizards and witches, and can transform themselves
into tigers and other beasts of prey with the view
of devouring their enemies, and that they can witch
away the lives of man and beast. They were in all
probability one of the tribes that were most persistent
in their hostility to the Aryan invaders.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> In Ceylon the
remnants of the aborigines are found in the forests and
on the mountains, and are universally looked upon
and feared as demons, the beliefs engendered therefrom
being exactly parallel to the witch beliefs of our own
country.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>There is similar evidence among European peoples.
Formerly in Sweden the name of Lapp seems to have
been almost synonymous with that of sorcerer, and the
same was the case with Finn. The inhabitants of the
southern provinces of Sweden believed their countrymen
in the north to have great experience in magic.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
The famous Gundhild, of Saga renown, was believed
to be a sorceress brought up among the Finns,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> and
even in respect of classical remains Mr. Warde Fowler
"prefers to think of the Fauni as arising from the contact
of the first clearers and cultivators of Italian soil
with a wild aboriginal race of the hills and woods."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg&nbsp;350]</a></span>
These facts are sufficient to show that the mythic influence
of a conquered race is a factor which may assist
in the discussion of the ethnological conditions of folklore,
and it is obvious that they reveal a very powerful
influence for the continuance of ancient ideas as well
as for the creation of fresh examples of ancient ideas
applied to new experiences. It is well in this connection
to remember certain historical facts connected with
the settlement of the English in Britain.</p>

<p>From Freeman's <i>Old English History</i> it appears that
at the beginning of the seventh century "the tract of
country which the English then ruled over south of the
Humber, coincided almost exactly with the boundary of
the Gaulish portion of Britain," as distinct from non-Aryan
Britain. This apparent recognition of Celtic
landmarks, says Professor Rhys, by the later invaders,
"is a fact, the historical and political significance of
which I leave to be weighed by others,"<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> and I venture
to suggest that one important result is to show Britain
to have contained an Aryan culture-ground and a
non-Aryan culture-ground. If we try to step from
one to the other we quickly discover the mythic relationship
of conqueror to the conquered.</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>Thus in the Anglo-Saxon life of St. Guthlac we have
an interesting glimpse into the conditions of the country
and the attitude of the two hostile races, Celts and
Teutons, to each other.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is in Britain a fen of immense size which begins
from the river Granta, not far from the city, which is named
Grantchester ... a man named Tatwine said that he knew
an island especially obscure, which ofttimes many men had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg&nbsp;351]</a></span>attempted to inhabit, but no man could do it on account of
manifold horrors and fears, and the loneliness of the wild
wilderness.... No man ever could inhabit it before the
holy man Guthlac came thither on account of the dwelling
of the accursed spirits there.... There was on the island a
great mound raised upon the earth, which same of yore men
had dug and broken up in hopes of treasure.... Then in
the stillness of the night it happened suddenly that there
came great hosts of the accursed spirits, and they filled the
house with their coming, and they poured in on every side
from above and beneath and everywhere. They were in
countenance horrible, and they had great heads and a long
neck and lean visage; they were filthy and squalid in their
beards, and they had rough ears and distorted face, and
fierce eyes and foul mouths: and their teeth were like horses'
tusks, and their throats were filled with flame, and they were
grating in their voice: they had crooked shanks and knees,
big and great behind, and distorted toes, and shrieked
hoarsely with their voices, and they came with such immoderate
noises and immense horror that it seemed to him
that all between heaven and earth resounded with their
dreadful cries. Without delay, when they were come into
the house, they soon bound the holy man in all his limbs, and
they pulled and led him out of the cottage and brought him
to the black fen and threw and sunk him in the muddy
waters. After that they brought him to the wild places of
the wilderness, among the dense thickets of brambles that
all his body was torn. After they had a long time thus
tormented him in darkness they let him abide and stand
awhile, then commanded him to depart from the wilderness,
or if he would not do so they would torment and try him with
greater plagues."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p></div>

<p>These doings are not sufficiently remote from sober
fact for us to be unable to detect human enemies in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg&nbsp;352]</a></span>
supposed beings of the spirit world, and this conclusion
is confirmed by a later passage in the same narrative
describing Guthlac awakened from his sleep and hearing
"a great host of the accursed spirits speaking in British
[bryttisc] and he knew and understood their words
because he had been erewhile in exile among them."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
Guthlac in England is only experiencing what other
saints experienced elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> and we cannot doubt we
have in these reminiscences of saintly experience that
mixture of fact with traditional belief which would
follow the priests of the new religions from their
native homes to the cell.</p>

<p>It is necessary to consider another great element in
human life with reference to its ethnological value, for
folklore has always been intimately associated with it,
and recently, owing to Mr. Frazer's brilliant researches,
this branch of folklore has been almost
unduly accentuated. I mean, of course, agriculture.
Mr. Frazer has ignored the ethnological side of agriculture,
and it has been appropriated by the student of
economics as a purely historical institution. This has
caused a special position to be given to agricultural
rites and customs almost without question and certainly
without examination, and it will be necessary to go
rather closely into the subject in order to clear up the
difficulties which present neglect has produced. I shall
once again draw my illustrations from the British Isles.</p>

</div>

<p>
<br />
</p>

<p>I put my facts in this way: (1) In all parts of Great
Britain there exist rites, customs, and usages connected
with agriculture which are obviously and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg&nbsp;353]</a></span>admittedly not of legislative or political origin, and which
present details exactly similar to each other in <i>character</i>,
but differing from each other in <i>status</i>; (2) that
the difference in status is to be accounted for by the
effects of successive conquests; (3) that the identity
in character is not to be accounted for by reference to
manorial history, because the area of manorial institutions
is not coincident with the area of these rites,
customs, and usages; (4) that exact parallels to them
exist in India as integral portions of village institutions;
(5) that the Indian parallels carry the subject
a step further than the European examples because
they are stamped with the mark of difference in race-origin,
one portion belonging to the Aryan people and
the other to the non-Aryan.</p>

<p>I shall now pick out some examples, and explain
from them the evidence which seems to me to prove
that race-distinction is the key for the origin of these
agricultural rites and usages in Europe as in India.
I have dealt with these examples at some length in
my book on the village community, and I shall
only use such details as I require for my immediate
purpose.</p>

<p>My first point is that to get at the survivals of the
village community in Britain it is not necessary to
approach it through the medium of manorial history.
Extremely ancient as I am inclined to think manorial
history is, it is unquestionably loaded with an artificial
terminology and with the chains so deftly forged by
lawyers. An analysis of the chief features in the types
of the English village community shows that the
manorial element is by no means a common factor in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg&nbsp;354]</a></span>
the series. These types mark the transition from the
tribal form to the village form. In Harris Island we
have the chief with his free tribesmen around him, connected
by blood kinship, living in scattered homesteads,
just like the German tribes described by
Tacitus. Under this tribal community is the embryo
of the village community, consisting of smaller tenantry
and cottar serfs, who live together in minute villages,
holding their land in common and yearly distributing
the holdings by lot. In this type the tribal constitution
is the real factor, and the village constitution the subordinated
factor as yet wholly undeveloped, scarcely
indeed discernible except by very close scrutiny.</p>

<p>At Kilmorie the tribal community is represented
merely by the scattered homesteads. These are occupied
by a joint farm-tenantry, who hold their lands
upon the system of the village community. Here the
village constitution has gradually entered into, so to
speak, the tribal constitution, and has almost absorbed
it.</p>

<p>At Heisgier and Lauder the tribal community is represented
by the last link under the process of dissolution,
namely, the free council of the community by
which the village rights are governed, while the village
community has developed to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>At Aston and at Malmesbury the old tribal constitution
is still kept alive in a remarkable manner, and I
will venture to quote from my book the account of the
evolution at Aston of a tenantry from the older tribal
constitution, because in this case we are actually dealing
with a manor, and the evidence is unique so far as
England is concerned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg&nbsp;355]</a></span>
The first point is that the village organisation, the
rights of assembly, the free open-air meetings, and the
corporate action incident to the manor of Aston and
Cote, attach themselves to the land divisions of sixteen
hides, because although these hides had grown in 1657
into a considerable tenancy, fortunately as a tenancy
they kept their original unity in full force and so obstinately
clung to their old system of government as to
keep up by <i>representation</i> the once undivided holding of
the hide. If the organisation of the hide had itself disappeared,
it still formed the basis of the village government,
the sixteen hides sending up their sixteen <i>elected</i>
representatives. How the tenancy grew out of the original
sixteen homesteads may perhaps be conjecturally set
forth. In the first place the owners of the yard-lands succeeded
to the place originally occupied by the owners of
the sixteen hides. Instead of the original sixteen group-owners
we have therefore sixty-four individual owners,
each yard-land having remained in possession of an
owner. And then at succeeding stages of this dissolution
we find the yard-lands broken up until, in 1848,
"some farmers of Aston have only half or even a
quarter of a yard-land, while some have as many as
ten or eleven yard-lands in their single occupation."
Then disintegration proceeded to the other proprietary
rights, which, originally appendant to the homestead
only, became appendant to the person and not to the
residence, and are consequently "bought and sold as
separate property, by which means it results that persons
resident at Bampton, or even at great distance,
have rights on Aston and Cote Common." And finally
we lose all trace of the system, as described by Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg&nbsp;356]</a></span>
Horde and as depicted by the representative character
of the Sixteens, and in its place find that "there are
some tenants who have rights in the common field and
not in the pasture, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i> several occupiers
have the right of pasture who do not possess any portion
of arable land in the common field," so that both
yard-lands and hides have now disappeared, and absolute
ownership of land has taken their place. Mr.
Horde's MS. enables us to proceed back from modern
tenancy-holding to the holding by yard-lands; the
rights of election in the yard-lands enable us to
proceed back to the original holding of the sixteen
hides.</p>

<p>At Hitchin, which is Mr. Seebohm's famous example,
we meet with the manorial type. But its features are
in no way peculiar. There is nothing which has not
its counterpart, in more or less well-defined degree, in
the other types which are not manorial. In short, the
manorial framework within which it is enclosed does
little more than fix the details into an immovable setting,
accentuating some at the expense of others,
legalising everything so as to bring it all under the
iron sovereignty which was inaugurated by the Angevin
kings.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that these examples are but varying
types of one original. The Teutonic people, and their
Celtic predecessors, came to Britain with a tribal, not an
agricultural, constitution. In the outlying parts of the
land this tribal constitution settled down, and was only
slightly affected by the economical conditions of the
people they found there; in the more thickly populated
parts this tribal constitution was superimposed upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg&nbsp;357]</a></span>
an already existing village constitution in full vigour.
We, therefore, find the tribal constitution everywhere&mdash;in
almost perfect condition in the north, in Wales,
and in Ireland; in less perfect condition in England.
We also find the village constitution everywhere&mdash;in
almost embryo form in the north, Wales, and in Ireland;
in full vigour and force in England, especially in that
area which, as already noted, has been identified as the
constant occupation-ground of all the races who have
settled in Britain.</p>

<p>Now the factor which is most apparent in all these
cases is the singular dual constitution which I have
called tribal and village. It is only when we get to such
cases as Rothwell and Hitchin that almost all traces of
the tribal element are lost, the village element only
remaining. But inasmuch as this village element is
identical in <i>kind</i>, if not in degree, with the village
element in the other types, and inasmuch as topographically
they are closely connected, we are, I contend,
justified in concluding that it is derived from the same
original&mdash;an original which was composed of a tribal
community with a village community in serfdom
under it.</p>

<p>This dual element should, I think, be translated into
terms of ethnology by appealing to the parallel evidence
of India. There the types of the village community
are not, as was thought by Sir Henry Maine and others,
homogeneous. There the dual element appears, the
tribal community at the top of the system, the village
community at the bottom of the system. But in India
a new factor is introduced by the equation of the two
elements with two different races&mdash;the tribal element<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg&nbsp;358]</a></span>
being Aryan, and the village element non-Aryan. Race-origins
are there still kept up and rigidly adhered to.
They have not been crushed out, as in Europe, by
political or economical activity.</p>

<p>But if crushed out of prominent recognition in
Europe, are we, therefore, to conclude that their relics
do not exist in peasant custom? My argument is that
we cannot have such close parallels in India and in
England without seeing that they virtually tell the same
story in both countries. It would require a great
deal to prove that customs, which in India belong
now to non-Aryan aborigines and are rejected by the
Aryans, are in Europe the heritage of the Aryan
race.</p>

<p>The objections to my theory have been formulated by
Mr. Ashley, who follows Mr. Seebohm and M. Fustel
de Coulanges as an adherent of the chronological
method of studying institutions. Like the old school
of antiquaries, this new school of investigators into the
history of institutions gets back to the period of Roman
history, and there stops. Mr. Ashley suggests that because
C&aelig;sar describes the Celtic Britons as pastoral,
therefore agriculture in Britain must be post-Celtic. I
will not stop to raise the question as to who were the
tribes from which C&aelig;sar obtained his evidence. But it
will suffice to point out that if C&aelig;sar is speaking of the
Aryan Celts of Britain&mdash;and this much seems certain&mdash;he
only proves of them what Tacitus proves of the
Aryan Teutons, what the sagas prove of the Aryan
Scandinavians, what the vedas prove of the Aryan
Indians, what philology, in short, proves of the primitive
Aryans generally, namely, that they were distinctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg&nbsp;359]</a></span>
hunters and warriors, and hated and despised the tillers
of the soil.</p>

<p>It does not, in point of fact, then, help the question
as to the origin of agricultural rites and usages to turn
to Aryan history at all. In this emergency Roman
history is appealed to. But this is just one of those
cases where a small portion of the facts are squeezed in
to do duty for the whole.</p>

<p>Both M. Fustel de Coulanges and Mr. Seebohm think
that if a Roman origin can be <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> shown for the
economical side of agricultural institutions, there is
nothing more to be said. But they leave out of consideration
a whole set of connected institutions. Readers
of Mr. Frazer's <i>Golden Bough</i> are now in possession of
facts which it would take a very long time to explain.
They see that side by side with agricultural economics
is agricultural religion, of great rudeness and barbarity,
of considerable complexity, and bearing the stamp of
immense antiquity. The same villagers who were the
observers of those rules of economics which are thought
to be due to Roman origin were also observers of ritual
and usages which are known to be savage in theory and
practice. Must we, then, say that all this ritual and
usage are Roman? or must we go on ignoring them as
elements in the argument as to the origin of agricultural
institutions? One or the other of these alternatives
must, I contend, be accepted by the inquirer.</p>

<p>Because the State has chosen or been compelled for
political reasons to lift up peasant economics into manorial
legal rules, thus forcibly divorcing this portion of
peasant life from its natural associations, there is no
reason why students should fix upon this arbitrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg&nbsp;360]</a></span>
proceeding as the point at which to begin their examination
into the origin of village agriculture. Manorial tenants
pay their dues to the lord, lot out their lands in intermixed
strips, cultivate in common, and perform generally
all those interesting functions of village life with which
Mr. Seebohm has made us familiar. But, in close
and intimate connection with these selfsame agricultural
economical proceedings, it is the same body of
manorial tenants who perform irrational and rude customs,
who carry the last sheaf of corn represented in
human or animal form, who sacrifice animals to their
earth deities, who carry fire round fields and crops,
who, in a scarcely disguised ritual, still worship deities
which there is little difficulty in recognising as the
counterparts of those religious goddesses of India who
are worshipped and venerated by non-Aryan votaries.
Christianity has not followed the lead of politics, and
lifted all this portion of peasant agricultural life into
something that is religious and definite. And because
it remains sanctioned by tradition, we must, in considering
origins, take it into account in conjunction
with those economic practices which have been unduly
emphasised in the history of village institutions. In
India primitive economics and religion go hand in
hand as part of the village life of the people; in England
primitive economics and <i>survivals</i> of old religions,
which we call folklore, go hand in hand as part of the
village life of the people. And it is not in the province
of students to separate one from the other when they
are considering the question of origin.</p>

<p>This is practically the whole of my argument from
the folklore point of view. But it is not the whole of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg&nbsp;361]</a></span>
the argument against the theory of the Roman origin
of the village community. I cannot on this occasion
re-state what this argument is, as it is set forth at some
length in my book. But I should like to point out that
it is in reality supported by arguments to be drawn
from ethnological facts. Mr. Ashley surrenders to my
view of the question the important point that ethnological
data, derived from craniological investigation,
fit in "very readily with the supposition that under the
Celtic, and therefore under the Roman rule, the cultivating
class was largely composed of the pre-Celtic
race; and allows us to believe that the agricultural
population was but little disturbed." Economically it
was certainly not disturbed by the Romans. If the
agricultural implements known to and used by the
Romans were never used in Britain after their departure;
if the old methods of land-surveying under the
agrimensores is not to be traced in Britain as a continuing
system; if wattle and daub, rude, uncarpentered
trees turned root upwards to form roofs, were the leading
principles of house-architecture, it cannot be alleged
that the Romans left behind any permanent marks of
their economical standard upon the "little disturbed
agricultural population." Why, then, should they be
credited with the introduction of a system of lordship
and serf-bound tenants, when both lordship and serfdom
are to be traced in lands where Roman power has
never penetrated, under conditions almost exactly
similar to the feudal elements in Europe? If it be accepted
that the early agricultural population of Britain
was non-Aryan; if we find non-Aryan agricultural rites
and festivals surviving as folklore among the peasants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg&nbsp;362]</a></span>
of to-day; why should it be necessary, why should it be
accepted as a reasonable hypothesis, to go to the
imperial and advanced economics of Rome to account
for those other elements in the composition of the
village community which, equally with the rites and
festivals, are to be found paralleled among the non-Aryan
population living under an Aryan lordship in
India? The only argument for such a process is one of
convenience. It does so happen that the Roman theory
<i>may</i> account for some of the English phenomena. But,
then, the Celtic and Teutonic, or Aryan theory also
accounts for the same English phenomena, and, what
is more, it accounts for other phenomena not reckoned
by the Roman theory. My proposition is that the
history of the village community in Britain is the
history of the economical condition of the non-Aryan
aborigines; that the history of the tribal community is
the history of the Aryan conquerors, who appear as
overlords; and that the Romans, except as another
wave of Aryan conquerors at an advanced stage of
civilisation, had very little to do with shaping the
village institutions of Britain.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>It is necessary before leaving this subject to take note
of a point which may lead, and in fact has led to misconception
of the argument. I have stated that all
custom, rite, and belief which is Aryan custom, rite, and
belief, as distinct from that which is pre-Aryan&mdash;pre-Celtic
in our own country&mdash;must have a position in
the tribal system, and I have said that custom, rite,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg&nbsp;363]</a></span>
and belief which cannot be traced back to the tribal
system may be safely pronounced to be pre-tribal in
origin and therefore pre-Celtic, to have survived,
that is, from the people whom the Celts found in occupation
of the country when first they landed on its shores.
I did not interrupt my statement of the case to point
out one important modification of it, because this modification
has nothing to do with the great mass of custom
and belief now surviving as folklore, but I will deal
with this modification now so that I may clear up any
misconception. We have already ascertained that over
and above the custom and belief, which may be traced
back to their tribal origins, there are both customs and
beliefs which owe their origin to psychological conditions,
and there are myths surviving as folk-tales or
legends which owe their origin to the primitive philosophy
of earliest man. Neither of these departments
of folklore enters into the question of race
development. The first may be called post-ethnologic
because they arise in a political society of modern
civilisation which transcends the boundaries of race;
the second may be called pre-ethnologic, because
they arise in a savage society before the great races
had begun their distinctive evolution. The point
about this class of belief is that it has never been
called upon to do duty for social improvement and
organisation, has never been specialised by the Celt
or Teuton in Europe, nor by other branches of the
same race. The myth alone of these two groups
of folklore could have had an ethnological influence,
and this must have been very slight. It remained in
the mind of Aryan man, but has never descended to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg&nbsp;364]</a></span>
arena of his practical life. It has influenced his practical
life indirectly of course, but it has never become a brick
in the building up of his practical life. This distinction
between custom and belief which are tribal and custom
and belief which are not tribal, is of vast importance. It
has been urged against the classification of custom, rite,
and belief into ethnological groups that it does not allow
for the presence of a great mass of belief, primitive in
character and undoubtedly Aryan, if not in origin at all
events in fact. The objection is not valid. The custom,
rite, and belief which can be classified as distinctively
Aryan is that portion of the whole corpus of primitive
custom, rite, and belief, which was used by the Aryan-speaking
folk in the building up of their tribal organisation.
They divorced it by this use from the general
primitive conceptions, and developed it along special
lines. It is in its special characteristics that this belief
belongs to the tribal system of the Aryans, not in its
general characteristics. Not every custom, rite, and belief
was so used and developed. The specialisation caused
the deliberate rejection or neglect of much custom, rite,
and belief which was opposed to the new order of things,
and did not affect the practical doings of Aryan life.</p>

<p>There are thus three elements to consider: (1) the
custom, rite, and belief specialised by the Aryan-speaking
people in the formation and development of their
tribal system; (2) the custom, rite, and belief rejected
or neglected by the Aryan tribesmen; and (3) the
belief which was not affected by or used for the tribal
development, but which, not being directly antagonistic
to it, remained with the primitive Aryan folk as survivals
of their science and philosophy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg&nbsp;365]</a></span>
For ethnological purposes we have only to do with
the first group. It is definite, and it is capable of
definite recognition within the tribe. When once it
was brought into the tribal system it ceased to exist in
the form in which it was known to general savage
belief; it developed highly specialised forms, took its
part in the formation of a great social force, a great
fighting and conquering force, a great migratory force.
In accomplishing this task it grew into a solid system,
each part in touch with all other parts, each part an
essential factor in the ever-active forces which it helped
to fashion and control.</p>

<p>It is in this wise that we must study its survivals
wherever they are to be found, and the study must be
concentrated within certain definite ethnographic areas.
If I were to pursue the subject and choose for my
study the folklore of Britain, I should have to object to
the treatment accorded to British custom, rite, and
belief by even so great an authority as Mr. Frazer,
because they are used not as parts of a tribal system
but as mere detritus of a primitive system of science, or
philosophy. According to my views they had long since
become separated from any such system and it is placing
them in a wrong perspective, giving them a false value,
associating them with elements to which they have no
affinity to divorce them from their tribal connection. The
custom, rite, and belief which were tribal, when they were
brought to their present ethnographic area, cannot be
considered in the varied forms of their survival except
by restoration to the tribal organisation from which
they were torn when they began their life as survivals.</p>

<p>What I have endeavoured to explain in this way are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg&nbsp;366]</a></span>
the principles which should govern folklore research
in relation to ethnological conditions. The differing
races which made up the peoples of Europe before the
era of political history must have left their distinctive
remains in folklore, if folklore is rightly considered as
the traditional survivals of the prehistory period. To
get at and classify these remains we must be clear as
to the problems which surround inquiry into them.
The solution of these problems will place us in possession
of a mass of survivals in folklore which are
naturally associated with each other, and which stand
apart from other survivals also naturally associated
with each other. In these two masses we may detect
the main influences of the great tribal races and the
non-tribal races. We cannot, I think, get much
beyond this. We may, perhaps, here and there,
detect smaller race divisions&mdash;Celtic, Teutonic, Scandinavian
or other distinctions, according to the area
of investigation&mdash;but these will be less apparent,
less determinable, and will not be so valuable to
historical science as the larger division. To this we
shall by proper investigation be indebted for the
solution of many doubtful points of the prehistoric
period, and it is in this respect that it will appeal to

does not, I think, disprove my theory. It ignores it, and confines the
problem to legend and folk-tale. Mr. Nutt's powerful, but not conclusive,
study is to be found in <i>Folklore</i>, x. 71-86, and my reply and correspondence
resulting therefrom are to be found at pp. 129-149.</p></div>

shape by modern scholars: thus Mr. Stock, in his work on <i>C&aelig;sar
de bello Gallico</i>, notes and compares the evidence of C&aelig;sar, Strabo,
Diodorus Siculus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Mela, Lucan, and Pliny as
it has been interpreted by modern scholars (see pp. 107-113), and he
is followed by Mr. T. Rice Holmes in his study of <i>C&aelig;sar's Conquest
of Gaul</i>, pp. 532-536. The Druidic cult of belief in immortality,
metempsychosis, ritual of the grove, augury, human sacrifice, is all
set out and discussed. These are the continental Druidic beliefs
and practices, and they may be compared with the Druidic Irish
beliefs and practices in Eugene O'Curry's <i>Manners and Customs
of the Ancient Irish</i>, lect. ix. and x. vol. ii. pp. 179-228, and Dr. Joyce's
<i>Social History of Ancient Ireland</i>, i. 219-248, where "the points of
agreement and difference between Irish and Gaulish Druids" are
discussed. Mr. Elton notices the difference between the continental
and the British Druids, but ascribes it to unequal development (<i>Origins
of Eng. Hist.</i>, 267-268). C&aelig;sar's well-known account of the wickerwork
sacrifice is very circumstantial. It is not repeated by either
Diodorus or Strabo, who both refer to individual human sacrifice.
Pliny introduces the mistletoe, oak, and serpent cults, and the other
three authorities are apparently dependent upon their

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_474_474" id="Footnote_474_474"></a><a href="#FNanchor_474_474"><span class="label">[474]</span></a> The mixture of Celt and Iberian is very ably dealt with by Mr.
Holmes in his <i>C&aelig;sar's Conquest of Gaul</i>, pp. 245-322, and by Ripley,
<i>Races of Europe</i>, 461, 467, together with cap. vii. and xii.; see also
Sergi, <i>Mediterranean Race</i>, cap. xii.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_475_475" id="Footnote_475_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475_475"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> The intermarrying of the Picts with the Celts of the district they
conquered is mentioned in all the chronicles as an important and
significant rite, which determined the succession to the Pictish throne
through the female side (Skene's <i>Chron. of the Picts and Scots</i>, 40, 45,
126, 319, 328, 329). Beda, i. cap. i., mentions female succession. Skene
discusses this point in <i>Celtic Scotland</i>, i. 232-235, and McLennan includes
it in his evidence from anthropological data (<i>Studies in Anc. Hist.</i>, 99).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_476_476" id="Footnote_476_476"></a><a href="#FNanchor_476_476"><span class="label">[476]</span></a> Mr. Seebohm is the best authority for the importance of the non-tribesman
in Celtic law (<i>Tribal System in Wales</i>, 54-60).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_477_477" id="Footnote_477_477"></a><a href="#FNanchor_477_477"><span class="label">[477]</span></a> The local cults in Great Britain which are not Celtic in form, and do
not seem to be connected with Celtic religion on any analogy, are those
relating to Cromm Cruaich, referred to in the <i>Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick</i> (see Whitley Stokes in <i>Revue Celtique</i>, i. 260, xvi. 35-36;
O'Curry, <i>MS. Materials of Anc. Irish History</i>, 538-9; Joyce, <i>Social
History of Ancient Ireland</i>, i. 275-276; Rhys, <i>Celtic Heathendom</i>, 200-201).
I do not follow Rhys in his identification of this cult as a part
of the ceremonies on mounds, and suggest that Mr. Bury in his <i>Life of
St. Patrick</i>, 123-125, gives the clue to the purely local character of this
idol worship which I claim for it. Similarly the overthrow of the
temple at Goodmanham, Godmundingham, described by Beda, ii.
cap. 13, with its priest who was not allowed to carry arms, or to ride on
any but a mare, is the destruction of a successful local cult, not of
a national or tribal religion. I confess that Dr. Greenwell's observations
in connection with his barrow discoveries (<i>British Barrows</i>, 286-331) are
in favour of an early Anglican cultus, but I think his facts may be
otherwise interpreted, and in any case they confirm my view of the
special localisation of this cult.</p></div>
